# DeepSeek-V4-Flash (DS4F) on 11× A64FX (Fugaku) — build & run repro

EP-only inference harness for DeepSeek-V4-Flash (284B total / 13B activated MoE,
43 MoE layers, hidden 4096, vocab 129280). 256 routed experts are EP-sharded
~23–24/node; dense (attn / shared expert / router / embed / head) is replicated and
computed redundantly per node. Weights stay quantized in HBM with on-demand dequant
(dense FP8 e4m3fn, experts MXFP4) to fit ~25 GB usable HBM2/node.

This file is the **operational repro** for the real-weight Tier-B1 run. The science /
status lives in the auto-memory `project_ds4f_flash_ep_harness`; the design rationale
in `~/.claude/plans/plan-deepseek-v4-flash-iterative-prism.md`.

## TL;DR

```sh
# inside a live 12-node alloc (shape 2x3x2; 1 node reserved for agent/claude control),
# from a64fx/llm:
./run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh                                  # 1. shard weights -> each node's /local (~22 GB/node)
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_EXACT=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh                # 2. exact Tier-B1 forward on the 11 EP nodes
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_TIERB2=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh              # 2b. Tier-B2 compressor/indexer (reuses blobs)
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_FP8_BF16=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh           # 2c. bf16-pv dense promote (fast decode)
./run_ds4f_longctx_11n.sh                                # 2d. long-ctx Tier-B2 bench (O(topk) payoff)
```

All launchers default to `NP=11`, `EXCLUDE=0,0,0` (drops the agent/claude-colocated
node — the 12th node is reserved for agent control and would OOM under the ~22 GB load),
and regenerate `vcoord_ds4f.txt` + the Tofu topology for the *current* alloc. Steps 2b–2d
reuse the Step-1 blobs (no re-stage). Last Tier-B1 validation (job 49092345, 2026-06-05):
`rc=0`, NaNs=0, argmax=122293, prefill 10.44 / decode 10.16 tok/s, arena 22.18 /
RSS 21.81 GB/node. Per-config numbers are in Steps 2–2d.

## Files (branch `ds4f`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `common/ds4f.h` | self-contained model: config / alloc / forward / loaders / dequant matvecs |
| `a64fx/llm/ds4f_runner.c` | single-node driver (no uTofu) — validation vehicle |
| `a64fx/llm/ds4f_ep_runner.c` | 11-node uTofu EP driver (links `-ltofucom`) |
| `a64fx/llm/ds4f_stage.c` | sharded safetensors → per-node `/local/ds4f/rank<rr>.blob` stager |
| `a64fx/llm/run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh` | stage launcher (mpiexec, PMIX_RANK self-ID) |
| `a64fx/llm/run_ds4f_11n.sh` | run launcher (vcoord + topo + mpiexec) |
| `a64fx/llm/run_ds4f_longctx_11n.sh` | long-ctx Tier-B2 bench wrapper (ctx-warm + sentinel) |
| `a64fx/utofu-tests/tofu_topo_helper` | MPI program that writes `tofu_topo.txt` (rank→coords) |

Build is native `fcc`/`FCC` (NOT `fccpx`/`FCCpx`); binaries run directly, **no `pjsub`**
for the run itself (this is a native A64FX node). The launchers rebuild the runner via
`make ds4f_ep_runner CC=fcc OPENMP=1`.

## Prerequisites

- A live allocation: `pjsub -L "node=12,..."` shape **2×3×2** (12 nodes; 1 is the
  claude/login node, excluded → 11 EP nodes). Confirm with `env | grep PJM_MPI_SHAPE`
  (`X=2 Y=3 Z=2`) and `echo $PJM_SUBJOBID`.
- Real weights at `$HOME/models/ds4f` (config.json + 46 safetensors shards).
- PATH must **PREPEND** `/opt/local/mpiexec:/opt/FJSVxtclanga/tcsds-1.2.43/bin` (the
  launchers do this) so `mpiclang` (for the topo helper) and `fcc` both stay resolvable.

## Step 1 — stage weights to node-local `/local`

```sh
cd a64fx/llm
DS4F_STAGE_FLUSH_GB=2 ./run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh
```

Each rank self-identifies via `PMIX_RANK` (own_mpi exports it to non-MPI binaries) and
streams **only its owned tensors** (dense → all ranks; expert `e` → rank `e%11`) file→file
from the read-only safetensors mmap into `/local/ds4f/rank<rr>.blob` + a text manifest.
RSS stays ~tens of MB (it is NOT loading weights). `DS4F_STAGE_FLUSH_GB=2` bounds the
HBM `/local` dirty-page cache (fdatasync + `fadvise(DONTNEED)` every 2 GB) — without it
the blob's dirty pages pile up in HBM (~7 GB) and OOM-segfault the stage.

Done signal: 11× `a64fx/llm/ds4f_stage_rank*.txt` on the shared FS. ~1270 s wall
(shared-FS read-bound, ~22 GB/node). The launcher prints `OK: all 11 ranks staged`.

## Step 2 — run the exact Tier-B1 forward

```sh
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_EXACT=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh
```

The launcher: regenerates `vcoord_ds4f.txt` (excludes relative `(0,0,0)`), runs
`tofu_topo_helper` → `a64fx/llm/tofu_topo.txt` for **this** alloc, builds the runner,
then `mpiexec -np 11 -vcoordfile vcoord_ds4f.txt build/ds4f_ep_runner`. Each rank mmaps
its `/local` blob, copies tensors into a ~22 GB arena (FP8 e4m3fn dense + MXFP4 expert
nibble-repack), and runs prefill 8 + decode 16. Output: per-rank
`ds4f_ep_{perf,load}_rank*.txt` + `ds4f_ep_rank00.txt` summary.

`DS4F_REAL=1` pins dense to FP8 (real e4m3fn bytes). `DS4F_EXACT=1` swaps the dense
stand-ins for the exact DeepSeek math (RoPE/YaRN, per-head q-norm, MQA sliding-window +
sink attn, grouped low-rank o-proj, sqrtsoftplus gate, swiglu clamp); `exact=0` is
byte-identical to the stand-in path.

## Step 2b — Tier-B2 (compressor/indexer) real-weight run

```sh
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_TIERB2=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh      # implies EXACT; reuses the SAME blobs
```

No re-stage needed: the compressor/indexer tensors (`layers.L.attn.compressor.*`,
`.indexer.*`) are classified `CLS_DENSE` by the stager, so they are already in every
rank's `/local` blob. `ds4f_load_real` loads them by name and widens to f32 at load
time (BF16→f32 for the compressor/`weights_proj`/indexer-compressor weights, FP8
e4m3fn + E8M0 128² dequant for `indexer.wq_b`, F32 `ape` + BF16 `norm` direct). The
forward then runs the stateful 21-CSA + 20-HCA compressor/indexer path.

Validated (job 49092345, 2026-06-05): `rc=0`, 11/11, **NaNs=0**, argmax=98198
(lockstep), RSS 21.82 GB/node. **Perf:** decode 0.56 / prefill 0.60 tok/s — attention
is 94.8 % because the f32 compressor/indexer matvecs are pure overhead at short ctx
(prefill 8 + decode 16 = 24 positions). Tier-B2 only amortizes past ~`index_topk=512`
context (its point is O(topk) long-context attention); the kernels are f32 reference
implementations, not yet SVE/quant-optimized (the speed follow-up).

## Step 2c — real-weight bf16-pv dense promote (fast decode)

```sh
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_FP8_BF16=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh    # predequant replicated dense FP8 -> bf16-pv
```

No re-stage needed (same FP8 blobs). At load, the 9 replicated dense tensors (`head`,
attn `wq_a/wq_b/wkv/wo_a/wo_b`, router `gate`, shared-expert `sh_w1/w3/w2`) are requant'd
FP8→bf16 in the pair-interleaved `BF16_PV` layout via `ds4f_load_dense`; routed experts
stay MXFP4. **FP8→bf16 is lossless** (e4m3's 3-bit mantissa × 2^k block scale fits bf16's
7 mantissa bits with no rounding) ⇒ a pure speed win, no accuracy cost. The default
(no `DS4F_FP8_BF16`) takes the same-dtype fast path and is byte-identical to the FP8 run.
Set `DS4F_BF16_PV=0` to force plain (non-pv) bf16. Costs ~+6 GB (FP8 ~12 GB dense → bf16
~18 GB); safe at the harness's short ctx, watch the budget past ~8 K (the +6 GB pushes a
128 K KV cache over HBM).

Validated (reused `/local` blobs, EXCLUDE=0,0,0, prefill 8 + decode 16): `rc=0`, 11/11,
**NaNs=0**, argmax=60574 (lockstep), RSS **27.50 GB/node** (arena 26.02 GB, fits < 32 GB
HBM2). **Perf:** decode **16.73 tok/s** (+65 % over FP8's 10.16) / prefill **17.27**
(+63 % over 10.60) — near the synthetic bf16-pv 17.49 ceiling. The profile flips to
matvec-bound (o_proj 29 % + qkv 19 % + shared 11 %); comm ~20 % is the EP all-reduce
Amdahl floor (same as synthetic). MXFP4-dense is NOT promotable from real FP8 (lossy) —
`ds4f_load_dense` aborts on an MXFP4 dense dest.

## Step 2d — long-context Tier-B2 run (the O(topk) payoff)

```sh
./run_ds4f_longctx_11n.sh                       # ctx=16384, combined bf16-pv + Tier-B2
DS4F_CTX_WARM=8192 ./run_ds4f_longctx_11n.sh    # a lower curve point
```

The wrapper sets `DS4F_CTX_WARM=N`: after the (short) prefill, `ds4f_warm_kv(m,N)` +
`ds4f_warm_tb2(m,N)` fill the synthetic KV + compressed (`cmp_kv` / `idx_kv`) caches to
`N` positions, then decode runs from `pos=N`. Both fills are **deterministic** (fixed
per-layer splitmix64 seeds) and **rank-independent** (local caches only, no all-reduce)
⇒ lockstep is preserved across all 11 ranks. This measures decode/attn cost at long
context **without** the O(ctx²) cost of a real prefill of that length. `DS4F_MAXPOS`
auto-sizes to `CTX_WARM + MAXGEN + 256` (the runner asserts `ctx_warm + maxgen ≤ max_pos`).

Validated (combined `DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_FP8_BF16=1 DS4F_TIERB2=1`, reused blobs,
EXCLUDE=0,0,0, prefill 8 + decode 16, all rc=0 / 11/11 / NaNs=0 / argmax lockstep):

| ctx | attn ms | tb2prep ms | qkv | o_proj | decode tok/s | RSS GB | argmax |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24 (baseline) | 4.11 | 16.86 | 18.71 | 29.48 | 10.10 | 27.51 | 98198 |
| 8192 | 88.97 | 113.96 | 18.76 | 28.58 | 3.56 | 28.23 | 16 |
| 16384 | 95.96 | 159.68 | 18.85 | 28.56 | 3.00 | 28.95 | 10973 |
| 32768 | — OOM (`rc=137`) — | | | | | | |

- **O(topk) payoff (real weights):** doubling ctx 8192→16384 grew `attn` only **+7.9 %**.
  The CSA compressed-attn term is capped at `index_topk=512` in both (T = ctx/4 = 2048 →
  4096, both > 512) ⇒ CSA attn flat; the +7.9 % is the HCA(128) portion (ctx/128). Had
  attn scaled with T (no cap), ctx=16384 would be ~2800 ms (4.11 × 680) — **the cap saves
  ~29×**.
- **`tb2prep` grew +40 % per 2× ctx and was 41–48 % of decode.** *(SUPERSEDED — Step 2g
  root-caused this: the ctx-linear growth was `ds4f_index_topk`'s O(k·T) selection, not the
  `index_score` scan (1.2 %) nor the projections (~14 %). Fixed to O(T·log k); `tb2prep` is now
  ~12 % of decode. See "Current state" Step 2g.)* The scan reads T = ctx/4 compressed `idx_kv`
  positions to rank the top-512 — *activations*, immune to the topk cap and bf16 weight-quant;
  the weight-bound qkv/o_proj are ctx-flat.
- **HBM ceiling — it is the *weight* footprint, not KV.** The bf16 KV cache (Step 2e) is
  now landed and halves `kv_cache` to `max_pos · 512 · 2B · 43L`, yet **ctx=32768 still
  OOM-kills** under the gen config. The dominant resident cost is the **27.5 GB replicated
  dense weights** (inflated +6 GB by `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1`'s FP8→bf16 predequant), leaving only
  ~2.5 GB for KV+compressed caches. Halving a ~1.4 GB KV term cannot offset a 27.5 GB base.
  The real long-ctx levers are **shrinking the weights** (`DS4F_FP8_BF16=0` keeps dense FP8,
  −6 GB, slower decode) and **int8 KV** — see Step 2e and Remaining work.

## Step 2e — gen-quality + decode tok/s at 10k+ (real coding task, mHC + bf16 KV)

End-to-end greedy generation on **real** DeepSeek-V4-Flash weights, production sparse path
(`DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_TIERB2=1 DS4F_FP8_BF16=1` + **`DS4F_MHC=1`**), via a pure-Python
byte-level BPE tokenizer (`tools/ds4f_tokenizer.py`) and gen-mode in `ds4f_ep_runner.c`
(`DS4F_PROMPT_IDS` / `DS4F_GEN_OUT` / `DS4F_MAX_NEW`, greedy argmax feedback, eos=1).

```sh
./run_ds4f_gen_11n.sh                          # built-in quicksort code-completion prompt
PROMPT_FILE=my.txt MAX_NEW=200 ./run_ds4f_gen_11n.sh
```

**`DS4F_MHC=1` is REQUIRED for coherent output** — the model ships per-layer hyper-connection
weights (`hc_attn_*`/`hc_ffn_*` + global `hc_head_*`, `hc_mult=4`, `hc_sinkhorn_iters=20`);
the forward only uses them when `m->mhc` is set. With mHC **off** the residual collapses to a
single stream → architecturally wrong → garbage tokens (the "argmax-exact vs batched
reference" check does **not** catch this; it only verifies EP-path == single-node-path). The
cheap reference-free gate is teacher-forcing next-token accuracy (`DS4F_TF_CHECK=1`):

| config | TF next-token acc | gen output |
|---|---|---|
| mHC **off** | 0/23 = 0 % | `ايره peeled… 哈哈哈` (garbage) |
| mHC **on** (`DS4F_MHC=1`) | 16/23 = **69.6 %** | correct recursive quicksort (below) |

```
def quicksort(arr):
    """Sort a list of numbers in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm."""
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[0]
    left  = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr[1:] if x >  pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)         # ← model-generated, NaNs=0
```

**Decode tok/s at long context** (gen config: mHC + bf16 KV, prefill 8 + decode 16, all
rc=0 / 11/11 / NaNs=0 / argmax lockstep). These are the *heavy* (mHC-on) numbers — the
Step 2d O(topk) table above is the lighter mHC-off sparse-path characterization:

| ctx | decode tok/s | tb2prep | attn | RSS GB | arena GB/node | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24 (gen, real prompt) | 5.93 | — | — | 27.51 | — | coherent quicksort, mHC |
| 10240 | **2.99** | 38 % (126 ms) | 27 % (91 ms) | 27.96 | 26.11 | rc=0 |
| 16384 | **2.68** | 43 % (160 ms) | 27 % | 28.22 | 26.36 | rc=0 |
| 32768 | — | | | | | **OOM-kill** (sig=9 during warm-fill) |
| 65536 | — | | | | | died pre-load (PMIx — 32768-OOM aftermath, see OPS note) |

- Real-model decode *was* **~2.7–3 tok/s at 10–16K ctx** with `tb2prep` dominant (38–43 %).
  *(SUPERSEDED — Step 2g: `tb2prep`'s cost was `ds4f_index_topk` (O(k·T)), not the `index_score`
  scan. Fixed → **5.21 tok/s @ctx10240**, `tb2prep` ~12 %; **attn (48 %) is now dominant**. See
  "Current state" Step 2g.)* Both `tb2prep` and `attn` read *activations*, so weight-quant
  can't help them; int8 KV would cut `attn`.
- **bf16 KV did not raise the ctx ceiling much** — the blocker is the 27.5 GB weight base
  (see the HBM note above), not KV precision. ctx ≤ ~16K is the safe top under
  `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1`; reaching 32K needs `DS4F_FP8_BF16=0` (FP8 dense, −6 GB) and/or int8 KV.

## Step 2f — single-node decode roofline + FP8 prefill tile-dequant (alloc-free)

When the 11-node alloc is PMIx-degraded, this single-node, pthread-pinned bench
(`a64fx/llm/ds4f_decode_bw_bench.c`, `make ds4f_decode_bw`, runs directly on-node, pins
cores 12–59, leaves 0–11 + memory for the agent) rooflines every weight rep in the M=1
cold-HBM decode regime. Two confounds in the old `ds4f_fp8_fast_bench.c` were fatal and
are fixed here: **NUMA first-touch** (fill *through* the pool via `mmap`/`munmap` per pool
— glibc `aligned_alloc` recycles already-faulted pages, pinning the whole pool to CMG0 and
collapsing the read ceiling to single-CMG ~90 GB/s) and **cold cache** (a pool of P
distinct matrices cycled per sweep). Trust shapes ≥16 MB only; smaller ones are
barrier/L2-overhead-skewed. Gate = argmax+top5 vs an own-repr f32 reference (never bit-eq).

**Node read ceiling R ≈ 720 GB/s** (1T 42 → 12T 466 → 24T 714 → 48T 719). The decisive,
non-obvious result (it **inverts** the "FP8 = faster *and* −6 GB" premise):

| 48T, ≥16 MB shapes | bf16 | fp8-gather | fp8-magic | scalar | neon |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| wo_a[8192,4096] 32 MB | **610** (85 % R) | 64 | 106 | 23 | 34 |
| wo_b[4096,4096] 16 MB | **579** (93 % R) | 103 | 128 | 20 | 32 |
| bigK[4096,8192] 32 MB | **307** (42 % R) | 85 | 73 | 18 | 32 |
| wq_b[32768,1024] 32 MB | **373** (52 % R) | 50 | 56 | 13 | 27 |

- **FP8 on-demand decode is dequant/issue-bound, not BW-bound** (8–20 % of R, still scaling
  past 24T); **bf16-predequant is BW-bound** (~85 % of R) and **2.1–3.3× faster per dense
  matvec** despite 2× the bytes. On A64FX, FP8 trades 2× memory for 2–3× slower decode —
  speed vs memory is a fundamental tension, not a free win.
- **magic ≥ gather** within FP8 on the dominant dense shapes (wo_a 1.66×, wo_b 1.24×);
  gather wins only large-K (bigK 0.85×). magic flushes E4M3 subnormals via FTZ → argmax-exact
  on synthetic, but a real-weight argmax check gates flipping `DS4F_FP8_MAGIC`'s default.
- **scalar/NEON-128 refuted** for the matvec (3–7× slower than SVE-512) — the "free cores in
  decode → short-vector lower latency" idea loses; the 48T matvec is decode-op-throughput bound.
- **double-buffer (decode∥GEMM) refuted by the roofline** (no prototype built). The premise
  "cores are free in decode" is false — the matvec already runs on all 48 compute cores, so a
  producer/consumer split *repartitions* them rather than adding any. The wall is FP/SIMD-pipe
  issue of the dequant *arithmetic* (magic, the fast path, is FLA-bound — the load-pipe gather
  is slower), a resource **shared** by dequant and FMA: partitioning rows across cores can't
  raise aggregate FLA throughput, and magic still *scales* with cores at 48T (not plateaued),
  so uniform all-core use already beats reserving a specialized producer set. A split would only
  win if dequant were load-bound and FMA FLA-bound (disjoint pipes), but a single core's OoO
  already overlaps the gather (load pipe) with the FMA (FLA pipe). Net: neutral-to-negative.

**Landed (validated single-node, argmax-exact): FP8→bf16 FUSED tile-dequant prefill GEMM.**
`ds4f_gemm_worker` (`common/ds4f_impl.h`) now batches **FP8 dense** (the memory-lean default)
instead of falling back to per-token matvec. The **fused** kernel: for each 8-row group it
dequants one `TILE_K`-wide FP8 sub-tile (SVE LUT-gather + per-128-block E8M0 scale + `>>16`,
bit-identical to the load-time predequant) **into a tiny 8 KB L1 PV pair-buffer** (`uzp1`+`zip1`
interleave → the same `p_odd` layout the bf16 path uses), then immediately consumes it across all
M tokens with the peak `matvec_bf16_8x3_pv_acc` microkernel, accumulating over K tiles. **No bf16
HBM round-trip** and it reuses the exact bf16 microkernel — so the dequant hides behind the FMA
pipeline. `DS4F_EXACT=1 DS4F_FP8_BF16=0 DS4F_PREFILL_BATCH=64 DS4F_PREFILL_CHECK=1` → argmax
**0/64** mismatch, rel 8.5e-6 (K-tile reassoc; FP8→bf16 itself lossless).

*Evolution of this lever:* the first version expanded the whole row-slice to a bf16 scratch then
ran the plain `gemm_bf16_f32_tokmajor` — two penalties (bf16 HBM/L2 round-trip + the slower
non-PV kernel) capped it at **~53% of the +6 GB bf16-resident path** (18.4 vs 39 tok/s). Fusing
the dequant into the K-tile and switching to the PV 8×3 kernel removed both: **FP8 batched
prefill is now ~88% of bf16-resident** (A/B at L=16, P=384: fused-FP8 ~85–92 vs bf16-resident
~96–106 tok/s; equal within noise at L=8) — **with no +6 GB**. Decode (M=1) path untouched. The
residual ~12% is the gather-bound dequant compute not 100% hidden; closing it would need the
gather-free *magic* decode (real-weight-argmax-validation-blocked, FTZ subnormals).

## OPS gotchas (each cost a real cycle)

1. **A job restart wipes `/local` AND moves the alloc.** A new `pjsub`/restart →
   new `$PJM_SUBJOBID` →
   - `/local` is cleared → the staged blobs are GONE → `DS4F_REAL=1` opens a missing
     `/local/ds4f/rank<rr>.blob` → fast failure/segfault. **Re-run Step 1.**
   - the physical Tofu group changes (e.g. `12 19 15` → `7 19 0`) → any saved
     `tofu_topo.txt` is stale → `mpiexec` can't place ranks on nonexistent coords →
     instant `rc=1` (~2 s, "exceed limit on virtual coordinate"). **Never pass
     `SKIP_TOPO=1` across jobs** — let the launcher regenerate.

2. **There are two `tofu_topo.txt` files.** The run launcher reads the one in its CWD
   (`a64fx/llm/tofu_topo.txt`). Running the helper from `a64fx/utofu-tests/` writes a
   *different* file and does not update what the runner reads. Pre-verify from `llm/`
   or just trust the launcher's own regeneration (the default).

3. **Excluding the claude node.** claude's interactive node is the alloc node whose
   intra-group coord is `a=b=c=0`. Probe it: `utofu_query_my_coords()` prints
   `x y z 0 0 0`. own_mpi maps that to vcoord `(0,0,0)`, so `EXCLUDE=0,0,0` (the
   launcher default) drops it. **Verify** after topo regen: the placed
   `tofu_topo.txt` must NOT contain the `x y z 0 0 0` row.

   ```sh
   # one-shot probe of this node's coord (compile once):
   cat > /tmp/mycoord.c <<'EOF'
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <utofu.h>
   #ifndef TOFU_NCOORDS
   #define TOFU_NCOORDS 6

   Running the heavy ~22 GB load on the claude node OOM-kills the claude session (shared
   cgroup). Staging on it is safe (file→file, bounded RSS) but pointless.

4. **Orphaned `org/mpiexec` (PPID=1)** from a killed run holds ranks → later
   "exceed limit on virtual coordinate". Check `pgrep -af 'org/mpiexec|ds4f_ep_runner'`
   and kill stale ones (use a pattern that does NOT self-match the killing shell).

5. **stdout is not forwarded** from `mpiexec`'d ranks — only file writes survive. Wait on
   the 11× per-rank files, NOT a stdout banner.

6. **An OOM-kill (sig=9) degrades the remote PMIx service.** When a rank is `SIGKILL`ed
   (HBM OOM during warm-fill, e.g. ctx=32768), it cannot finalize MPI cleanly, leaving the
   `plexec`/PMIx daemon on that node in a bad state. **Every subsequent launch then dies
   pre-load in ~3 s** with `[ERR.] PLE 0080 plexec PMIx service error occurred.(nid=…)` and
   `rc=255`, `perf=0/11 load=0/11` — looks like a fresh crash but is aftermath. A short wait
   (45 s, even 180 s) does **not** reliably clear it; recovery usually requires recycling the
   alloc (new `pjsub` → `/local` wiped → re-stage Step 1, ~21 min). **Practical rule: don't
   probe ctx past the known ceiling (~16K) on a shared alloc you don't want to lose** — one
   OOM costs the whole allocation. The longctx wrapper now flags this (`rc≠0` with
   `load=0/11` ⇒ pre-load failure) instead of reporting `crash_hits=0`.

## Output discipline (keep agent context small)

Chain stage→run **detached** (`setsid nohup …`), funnel all output to log files, and
read only a compact sentinel — never stream the 11× per-rank dumps into the agent. A
single background waiter that polls the sentinel for an end marker (e.g. `RUN2_END`)
beats echo-ping polling. Pattern: write `STAGE done=N/11`, `RUN rc=…`, topo group,
crash grep, and the ~10-line `ds4f_ep_rank00.txt` to one `/tmp/*sentinel.txt`.

## Validated result (job 49092345, 2026-06-05)

```
STAGE done=11/11  wall=1272 s  (no OOM — bounded /local cache held)
RUN   rc=0  11/11 perf + 11/11 load  topo group 7 19 0 (claude excluded)
NaNs=0  argmax=122293  (deterministic; identical to the first validated run)
prefill  8 tok   95.8 ms/tok  10.44 tok/s  comm 13.3%  ar_calls=344
decode  16 tok   98.4 ms/tok  10.16 tok/s  comm 12.4%  72.9 GB/s-weights
arena 22.18 GB   RSS 21.81 GB / node   (fits ~25 GB usable HBM2)
per-phase decode: o_proj 33.4% + qkv 27.8% + shared 14.1% = ~75% replicated dense FP8;
                  experts 5.2%, attn 3.9%, head 2.2%, router 0.6%.
```

The dominator is replicated dense FP8 gather (same finding as the synthetic Stage 2/3
and the EP-runner). `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1` (Step 2c) promotes that dense to bf16-pv at load
and lifts real-weight decode to **16.73 tok/s** (+65 %); the remaining lever is batched
decode M>1 to amortize the 43 per-layer all-reduces.

## Current state (2026-06-07)

Everything below is **DONE + validated** on the 11 EP nodes (real DeepSeek-V4-Flash
weights), committed on branch `ds4f` (latest `8f38fb7`) except where noted:

- **Tier-B1 exact dense forward** (Step 2): RoPE/YaRN, per-head q-norm, MQA sliding-window
  + sink attn, grouped low-rank o-proj, sqrtsoftplus gate, swiglu clamp — argmax=122293,
  10.16 tok/s FP8 dense.
- **Tier-B2 compressor/indexer** (Step 2b): stateful 21-CSA + 20-HCA decode path, real
  weights loaded by name; bf16 weight-quant (`037a2d1`, −37 % tb2prep, argmax-exact);
  pooled+SVE compressor/indexer kernels (`f648b79`, 14× over the f32-reference path).
- **bf16-pv dense promote** (Step 2c): lossless FP8→bf16-pv at load, decode 16.73 tok/s
  (+65 %).
- **Long-ctx Tier-B2** (Step 2d): O(topk) payoff confirmed — attn +7.9 % per 2× ctx
  (capped at `index_topk=512`); the index *scan* is the new long-ctx ceiling. ctx-warm
  infra (`ds4f_ep_runner.c` `DS4F_CTX_WARM` + `run_ds4f_longctx_11n.sh`) is the only
  **uncommitted** piece as of this writing → committed alongside this doc.
- **Gen-quality + decode tok/s** (Step 2e): real coding-task generation produces coherent
  code (recursive quicksort) with **`DS4F_MHC=1`** (the key finding — mHC is required;
  without it, garbage). bf16 KV cache landed (halves KV). Measured decode **2.99 tok/s @
  ctx10240, 2.68 @ ctx16384** (mHC path; below the 10–15 target — `tb2prep`/attn bound).
  Two bugs fixed en route: the **`s_tb2_sel` heap overflow** (`index_topk=512 > max_pos`
  corrupted compressor ring-state → NaNs; size to `max(max_pos, index_topk)`), and the
  mHC-off architecture gap. Gen-mode + tokenizer + bf16 KV + these fixes are **uncommitted**
  as of this writing.
- **Single-node decode roofline + FUSED FP8→bf16 prefill GEMM** (Step 2f, `affb141`/`7426330`):
  `ds4f_decode_bw_bench.c` rooflines every weight rep cold-HBM (node R≈720 GB/s) — bf16 is
  BW-bound (~85 % R) and 2–3× faster/matvec than dequant-bound FP8; scalar/NEON and
  double-buffer **refuted**. The fused tile-dequant GEMM makes `DS4F_FP8_BF16=0` prefill ~88 %
  of the +6 GB bf16-resident speed (kills the +6 GB without losing prefill).
- **int8/SVE `index_score` scan** (`ae1167d`): resident per-position int8 (`DS4F_IDX_INT8`,
  default off). **argmax-exact (96/96) on real weights**, f32 path bit-identical, but a
  confirmed **negative for ≤16k decode** (the `DS4F_P_TB2SCAN` sub-timer proved the scan is
  1.2 % of decode, not the bottleneck).
- **Fast `index_topk` — the real decode bottleneck, FIXED (Step 2g, uncommitted).** Full
  per-component `tb2_prepare` profiling (`DS4F_P_TB2{QPROJ,ROPE,ICMP,WPROJ,LCMP,TOPK}` sub-timers)
  found the actual hot line: of `tb2prep`'s 126 ms @ctx10240, the projections/compressor sum to
  only **~17.7 ms** — the remaining **108.7 ms (86 % of `tb2prep`, 37 % of decode) is
  `ds4f_index_topk`**, the O(k·T) repeated-linear-scan selection (+ O(k²) sort). Replaced with an
  O(T·log k) **size-`npick` min-heap → τ threshold → merge {score>τ} ∪ lowest-index {score==τ}**
  that produces the *identical* selected set & order. **Result: decode 3.38 → 5.21 tok/s
  @ctx10240 (+54 %, 1.54×); `tb2topk` 108.7 → 4.19 ms (25.9×).** Validated: `tools/topk_equiv_test.c`
  432 adversarial trials (T≤4096, k=512, heavy ties, all-equal, relu-sparse, thr<T) **diff-empty**
  vs naive; 11-node real-weight ctx-warm A/B **argmax-exact 223/81819 fast==naive**, NaNs=0, RSS
  unchanged, lockstep held. New default; `DS4F_TOPK_NAIVE=1` keeps the O(k·T) reference. Scales
  BETTER with ctx (was the steepest ctx-linear decode term).
- **SVE decode-attn — attn 6.6×, decode +68 % (Step 2h, uncommitted).** With `index_topk` fixed,
  `attn` was the dominant decode phase (91 ms = 48 % @ctx10240). The two attn workers
  (`ds4f_attn_tb2_worker`, `ds4f_attn_exact_worker`) were four **scalar** loops — QK dot + PV axpy
  over `kv_lora=q_head_dim=512`, with per-element bf16 decode — running at ~0.2 GFLOP/s/core
  (scalar-issue/decode-bound, NOT bandwidth-bound: window=128 pos ~128 KB + ≤512 compressed pos
  ~1 MB, both L2-resident — so the earlier "int8 KV would cut attn" guess was wrong; the lever is
  vectorization). SVE-vectorized with the `svld1uh<<16` bf16-widen idiom (BIT-EXACT to `ds4f_bf16f`)
  + `svmla`/`svaddv`. The PV axpy keeps the j-outer loop so per-lane accumulation order matches
  scalar (bit-exact PV); only the QK dot's horizontal reduction reorders (tiny f32). **Result:
  attn 91.1 → 13.8 ms (6.6×); decode 5.21 → 8.75 tok/s @ctx10240 (+68 %, 1.68×)** — total session
  decode **3.38 → 8.75 tok/s (2.59×)**. Gated `DS4F_ATTN_SVE` (default 1; `=0` = scalar reference).
  *Validation subtlety (recorded as a lesson):* the SYNTHETIC ctx-warm argmax FLIPPED (223→294)
  under the reorder — but that is a near-tie over *junk* latents, **not** a regression. The real
  gate is real-weight gen + `DS4F_TF_CHECK=1`: SVE vs scalar gave **identical TF pred sequence
  (23/23) and identical 48-token greedy completion (diff-empty), TF_ACCURACY 69.6 % both** (the
  known-good coherent-gen baseline). So: synthetic-warm argmax is a SPEED signal only; gate any
  fp-reorder change on real-weight TF/gen, never synthetic argmax.

- **Fused block-diagonal o-proj — o_proj 2.47×, decode +20 % (Step 2i, committed).** With `attn`
  fixed, `o_proj` was the dominant decode phase (28.8 ms = 26 % @ctx10240). The grouped low-rank
  o-proj ran the block-diagonal `wo_a` as **`o_groups`=8 SEPARATE `ds4f_matvec` dispatches**, each
  `[o_lora=1024 × 4096]`. Two compounding costs: (1) 8 cross-CMG pool barriers/layer × 43 layers;
  (2) **cross-CMG NUMA reads** — `ds4f_fill`/`ds4f_promote_worker` first-touch `wo_a` via
  `rowsplit8(8192,…)` (thread *t* owns rows ~`[t·170,…]`), but each per-group matvec used
  `rowsplit8(1024,…)` so thread *t* read rows `g·1024 + [its 1024-slice]` — first-touched on a
  *different* CMG → remote HBM. Fused all 8 groups into ONE `ds4f_matvec_blockdiag` pool dispatch
  (`ds4f_mv_bd_worker`): split the full `o_inter=8192` rows once via `rowsplit8` (matches the
  first-touch → NUMA-local; well-balanced ~170 rows/thread), and pick the per-8-row-block input
  `s_attn + (i/o_lora)·gin` (8-row blocks never straddle a group since `o_lora%8==0`). **BIT-EXACT**
  (same kernel, same per-row dot/accum order; full-tensor + global row index reproduces
  `ds4f_row_slice`'s byte/scale offsets — PV `(i/8)·8K`, FP8/MXFP4 `i`-indexed). **Result: o_proj
  28.8 → 11.7 ms (2.47×, −17 ms); decode 8.72 → 10.47 tok/s @ctx10240 (+20 %)** — crosses the
  10 tok/s target floor; total session decode **3.38 → 10.47 tok/s (3.10×)**. Gated `DS4F_OPROJ_FUSE`
  (default 1; `=0` = per-group reference). *Validation:* ctx-warm argmax **identical** (294/90465,
  fuse==ref — bit-exact, no flip) + real-weight 64-tok gen A/B **token-identical** (diff-empty),
  NaNs=0, lockstep held, RSS unchanged. (Generalizable: any matvec whose per-call `rowsplit8` row
  count ≠ the tensor's full row count reads cross-CMG — fuse to the full-tensor split.)

- **Parallel q-norm+RoPE — decode +7.6 % (Step 2j, committed).** Splitting `qkv_proj` (18.6 ms)
  with per-matvec sub-timers (`DS4F_P_QKV_A/B/KV/ROPE`, NPHASE 16→20) revealed the surprise: it is
  NOT all matvec — `wq_b` matvec is 8.4 ms but **`ds4f_q_norm_rope` is 7.18 ms = 7.7 % of decode**
  (wq_a 0.97, wkv 0.72). That function ran **fully serial on tid0** (between the wq_b/wkv pool
  dispatches): a scalar `double`-accum dot + scale + RoPE over each of `n_heads`=64 heads × HD=512,
  × 43 layers — scalar-issue-bound, like the pre-2h attn loops. The heads are **independent and
  write disjoint `qh` slices**, so splitting them across the 48-core pool (`ds4f_qnr_worker`, head
  range `[nh·tid/nthr, nh·(tid+1)/nthr)`) is **BIT-EXACT** to the serial loop (identical per-head
  accumulation order/scale/RoPE — no fp reorder, unlike 2h). **Result: q-norm+RoPE 7.18 → 0.48 ms
  (15×); qkv_proj 18.6 → 12.0 ms; decode 10.47 → 11.29 tok/s @ctx10240 (+7.6 %)**; total session
  decode **3.38 → 11.29 tok/s (3.34×)**. Gated `DS4F_QNR_PAR` (default 1; `=0` = serial reference).
  *Validation:* ctx-warm argmax **identical** (294/90465 — bit-exact) + real-weight 64-tok gen A/B
  **token-identical** (64/64, diff-empty), NaNs=0, lockstep held, RSS unchanged. (Generalizable:
  serial scalar per-head/per-row activation loops between pool dispatches are a recurring decode
  lever — parallelize the independent units across the pool, bit-exact when units are disjoint.)

- **Parallel indexer RoPE+rotate+fp4 (tb2rope) — decode +5.2 % (Step 2k, committed).** Applying the
  2j pattern to the biggest `tb2prep` sub-op: `ds4f_index_step`'s per-head `RoPE + rotate_activation
  + fp4_act_quant_inplace` loop ran **fully serial on tid0** (between the qproj and weights pool
  dispatches) — `tb2rope` = 4.68 ms/tok = 5.0 % of decode @ctx10240. Each of the `index_heads`=64
  heads writes a disjoint `q_scr[h·hd..]` slice and all three ops touch only that slice (+ read-only
  rcos/rsin), so splitting heads across the pool (`ds4f_tb2rope_worker`) is **BIT-EXACT**. **Result:
  tb2rope 4.68 → 0.24 ms (19×); tb2prep 21.9 → 17.4 ms; decode 11.29 → 11.88 tok/s @ctx10240
  (+5.2 %)**; total session decode **3.38 → 11.88 tok/s (3.51×)**. Gated `DS4F_TB2ROPE_PAR` (default
  1; `=0` = serial reference). *Validation:* ctx-warm argmax **identical** (294/90465) + real-weight
  64-tok gen A/B **token-identical** (64/64, diff-empty), NaNs=0, lockstep held, RSS unchanged.
  (The other `tb2prep` sub-ops — lcmp/topk/scan/qproj — are already pooled or already-optimized, so
  this was the one remaining pure-serial sub-op; tb2prep's residue is now matvec/scan-bound.)

- **int8 W8A8 dense — decode +9.7 % AND −5.5 GB RSS (Step 2l, committed `99b76ad`).** The ONLY lever
  so far that cuts **both** speed and memory (every prior lever was speed-only). `DS4F_Q8_DENSE=1`
  (requires `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1`) repacks the 8 dominant dense bf16-pv tensors/layer (`wq_a`, `wq_b`,
  `wkv`, `wo_a`, `wo_b`, `sh_w1`, `sh_w3`, `sh_w2` = 344 total) → **int8 W8A8** (`matvec_sdot_8row`,
  `svdot`, ~1.03 B/elem from HBM = **half** of bf16's 2 B) with a **per-64-block absmax scale**
  (528 B/group = 16 B fp16 scales + 8×64 int8 — finer than per-row, preserves argmax fidelity).
  After repack the bf16 source is reclaimed via `MADV_DONTNEED`, so resident memory **shrinks**.
  Gate + head stay bf16-pv (argmax protection). **Result @ctx10240: decode 11.88 → 13.03 tok/s
  (+9.7 %); RSS 27.95 → 22.40 GB (−5.5 GB); dense weight traffic 12.82 → 7.34 GB/tok.** Dense phases
  ~halved: qkv_proj 11.97 → 7.50, o_proj 11.56 → 9.40, shared 7.19 → 6.13, `wq_b` 8.43 → 4.04. Total
  session decode **3.38 → 13.03 tok/s (3.85×)**. *Validation:* real-weight gen A/B (quicksort, greedy,
  `DS4F_MHC=1`, 48 new tok) is **TOKEN-IDENTICAL to the bf16 baseline** — prefill argmax 361, final
  74433 in both; the per-64-block scale preserves the greedy trajectory exactly (better than the
  "merely coherent" bar a lossy int8 transform would predict), NaNs=0, lockstep held. *Two bugs found
  + fixed:* (a) `DS4F_Q8_DENSE` was read only in `ds4f_alloc_synth`, never in `ds4f_load_real` →
  `m->q8_dense` stayed 0 and the promote was a silent no-op (mirror the env read into the real path);
  (b) the Step-2i fused block-diagonal o-proj worker `ds4f_mv_bd_worker` had **no `DS4F_Q8_PV`
  branch** → with int8 `wo_a`, `dst` (s_o1) was never written (0 on synth, NaN on real) — added a
  Q8_PV branch that re-quantizes the per-group block-diagonal x only when the group changes
  (`glora%8==0` ⇒ a quantize lands on a 64-block boundary), bit-exact to the per-group `ds4f_matvec`
  Q8 path (same `xq`/`xs`, same `(i/8)*gb` weight offset). *Latent bug (documented, non-default):* the
  per-group o-proj fallback (`DS4F_OPROJ_FUSE=0`) is broken for Q8 — `ds4f_row_slice` can't slice the
  528 B int8 group layout; only the fused path (global `(i/8)*gb` indexing) is correct. **The −5.5 GB
  directly attacks the ctx=32768 OOM ceiling** (the resident dense weights, not KV, are the wall —
  see Remaining-work item 2) and inverts the FP8-dense memory-vs-speed tradeoff for these 8 tensors
  (FP8-on-demand was −6 GB but *slower*; int8 W8A8 is −5.5 GB **and** faster). Gated `DS4F_Q8_DENSE`
  (default off in the base 11n runner — int8 is lossy so the synthetic argmax shifts, keep it the
  clean bf16-pv reference; default **on** in the perf/memory wrappers longctx + gen, commit `36fcf48`).
  *Two int8 RSS data points (safe band): ctx10240 = 22.40 GB (decode 13.03 tok/s), ctx16384 = 22.66 GB
  (decode 12.34 tok/s) → KV slope ~0.26 GB/6144 ctx (~0.35 GB/8192).* **PROJECTED ctx-ceiling lift:**
  bf16's 32768 OOM (rc=137, projected ~30.4 GB vs ~29–30 GB node ceiling) is a *weight*-footprint
  wall, not KV. With int8 dense, ctx32768 projects to **~23.4–24.4 GB (5–6 GB headroom)** even on the
  conservative bf16 slope, so **int8 dense alone should clear 32768 and likely reach ~64–128k** —
  a 4–8× context jump, not just a decode-speed win. *Confirm on a FRESH alloc only* (the standing
  rule forbids probing past 16k on a shared alloc — an OOM-kill degrades PMIx and loses the alloc).

- **int8 KV cache — −0.35 GB RSS @16k (scales linearly), real-weight token-identical (Step 2m, `DS4F_INT8_KV`, commit `0d8b6d1`).** The KV-memory half of the 256k push (pairs with 2l's int8 *dense*). `DS4F_INT8_KV=1` stores each `(layer,pos)` window KV latent `[kv_lora=512]` as **int8** (1 B vs bf16's 2 B) with a **STATIC per-channel scale** calibrated on the first `DS4F_INT8KV_CAL` positions (default 256; S5 scheme, de-risked in `tools/int8kv_probe.c`, L1-rel 0.0032). The latent's massive-activation sink channels (~1e3–1e5) are positionally *consistent*, so early calibration holds — naive per-token int8 is catastrophic (one sink dim sets the scale → O(1) dims vanish). **Streaming design (no straddle):** positions `[0,CAL)` stage to a small bf16 `kv_calbuf` while per-channel absmax accumulates; at the first `pos≥CAL` the scale **freezes**, the calbuf is quantized into the int8 store `kv_q`, and reads switch to int8 — freeze happens *between* `forward_token` steps, so at any instant every written position is wholly in calbuf (unfrozen) **or** wholly in kv_q (frozen), and the read path is a single hoisted branch (`kvbf = !frozen ? kv_calbuf : kv_cache`; `i8 = int8_kv && frozen`). Arena stays bf16-sized (`MAP_NORESERVE` ⇒ RSS = touched pages ⇒ int8 realizes the win). **Scope:** `int8_kv` forces `m->exact=1` and aborts batched prefill, so only the **two** streaming exact/tb2 attn read workers needed int8 branches (the synthetic/batched-prefill workers never run under it) — far less than the "~15 sites" the table once feared. *Validation (real weights, 11n, `DS4F_MHC=1`):* (a) **coherence** — gen with `CAL=64` (freeze fires ~gen-token 40, ~96 tokens read the frozen int8 window) is **TOKEN-IDENTICAL** to the bf16 baseline (137/137 ids; int8 never flipped a greedy argmax — better than the "merely coherent" bar a lossy transform predicts); (b) **int8 path genuinely active** — the longctx16384 *synthetic* warm argmax flips 16→28 under int8 (a lossy transform DOES change synthetic compute, proving it's not bypassed; synthetic argmax is a speed signal only); (c) **memory** — longctx16384 RSS **22.66 → 22.31 GB (−0.35 GB)**, matching the predicted KV halving (16384·512·43 B ≈ 344 MB), NaN=0, lockstep, rc=0. The −0.35 GB at 16k is small (KV is a thin slice there) but **linear in ctx → ~5.7 GB at 256k**, where it compounds with 2l's −5.5 GB dense. *One bug found + fixed:* during the pre-freeze calibration window the read path fell into the bf16 branch but `kv_cache` is `NULL` under int8_kv → segfault; fixed by pointing the bf16 base at `kv_calbuf` while unfrozen (synthetic A/B confirms the calbuf-bf16 read is **bit-identical** to the kv_cache-bf16 path). Gated `DS4F_INT8_KV` (default **off** — lossy, keep bf16 the clean reference). LOSSY by design ⇒ argmax NOT *guaranteed* bit-exact (coherence is the gate); it merely *happened* to be token-identical on this gen.

- **int8 compressed-latent cache (cmp_kv) — ctx ceiling ~200k → ~255k, real-weight token-identical (Step 2n, `DS4F_INT8_CMP`, uncommitted).** The Tier-B2 memory half of the 256k push (pairs with 2m's int8 *KV* and 2l's int8 *dense*). The Tier-B2 compressor cache `cmp_kv` (CSA 10,752 B/pos + HCA 320 B/pos = 11,072 B/pos f32) is the single largest off-arena allocation past ~64k. `DS4F_INT8_CMP=1` stores each compressed latent slot `[kv_lora=512]` as **int8** (¼ the f32 footprint) with the same **S5 static per-channel scale** scheme as int8 KV (2m): a small bf16 `cmp_calbuf` stages the first `DS4F_INT8CMP_CAL` *slots* (default 64) while per-channel absmax accumulates; at the first `slot≥CAL` the scale freezes, the calbuf quantizes into the int8 store `cmp_q`, and reads switch to int8 — freeze happens between `forward_token` steps so every slot is wholly in calbuf (unfrozen) or wholly in `cmp_q` (frozen), no straddle. Read path (`ds4f_attn_tb2_worker`) is a single hoisted **3-way** branch — `c_i8` frozen → `ds4f_sve_dot_i8s`/`ds4f_sve_axpy_i8s` over the per-channel scale; `cmpbf` pre-freeze → bf16 calbuf; else f32 (`DS4F_INT8_CMP=0`). Forces `m->exact=1`, tierb2-only. New fields `cmp_q/cmp_scale/cmp_iscale/cmp_absmax/cmp_calbuf/cmp_caln/cmp_frozen` in `ds4f_layer`; codec `ds4f_cmp_freeze`/`ds4f_cmp_append_i8` reuses the int8-KV i8s kernels. **slot = pos/ratio** (CSA ratio=4 ⇒ a slot every 4 positions). **THE MEASUREMENT GOTCHA (critical — see memory `project_ds4f_ctx_ceiling_measured`):** `cmp_kv`/`idx_kv` are THP-backed off-arena allocs that cost **real physical memory (MemFree) but are INVISIBLE to `/proc/self/statm` RSS** — at 131072 they are 2.72 GB physical with *zero* RSS change. **For any ctx-ceiling / OOM / memory-reduction work, validate against MemFree, NEVER RSS** (task #43 wrongly killed int8_cmp on an RSS A/B — RSS structurally cannot see the win). *Validation (synthetic longctx + real-weight gen, NP=11):* **(a) memory** — MemFree @131072 (FP8-on-demand dense + int8 KV) **4.52 → 5.57 GB = +1.05 GB**, EXACTLY the cmp_kv-only prediction (8,304 B/pos × 131072 = 1.04 GB); combined ceiling slope **36.7 → 28.7 KB/pos**; **(b) ceiling** — two-point MemFree fit lifts the hard ceiling (MemFree-2.0 floor) **~200k → ~255k** (safe MemFree-2.4 ~242k) — clears 262144 at the hard floor; **(c) coherence** — real-weight gen A/B with `CAL=8` (forces freeze@slot8 ⇒ pos32, within the ~160-pos eos-terminated gen) is **TOKEN-IDENTICAL** to f32 cmp_kv (137/137, first_diff=NONE), int8 frozen path genuinely exercised, NaN=0, lockstep, rc=0. *Gotcha when testing:* a short gen hits eos ~136 tok ⇒ total pos ~160 < 256, so the **prod `CAL=64` never freezes in a short gen** — lower `CAL` (e.g. 8) to exercise the int8 path, else you only test the bf16 calbuf. Gated `DS4F_INT8_CMP` (default **off**, zero cost when off), `DS4F_INT8CMP_CAL` = calib window in SLOTS (default 64). **The combined int8 memory stack is now FP8-on-demand dense + int8 KV + int8 cmp → ~255k ctx.** Next mem lever: **int8 `idx_kv`** (2,688 B/pos → +2 KB/pos saved, slope → 26.6, ceiling → ~270k+) for a robust 262144 margin.

- **Direct MXFP4/FP8 GEMM register-dequant — MXFP4 tile-dequant +1.38–1.72× @M≥16 (real-weight 11n: +7.9% prefill, token-exact), FP8 confirmed already-optimal (Step 2o, `DS4F_MXFP4_GEMM_TILE`, uncommitted).** Investigated the user ask "optimize direct mxfp4/fp8 GEMM, decode to fp16/fp32 on register via SVE ld+insn". Two halves, both bench-driven (`ds4f_gemm_test` FP8+MXFP4 sweeps, 12T/1CMG, exp15-free synth, argmax + **relL2 vs f32 single-token ref**, never bit-equality):
  - **FP8 — already optimal, no change.** The Step-2f on-demand tile-dequant (`svld1ub`→LUT-gather→f32→bf16 L1 tile→`8x3_pv`, no resident bf16, −6 GB) IS the on-register SVE-ld dequant. Confirmed **bf16-FMA COMPUTE-bound, not dequant-bound**: register **magic** decode (no gather/LUT) vs gather is **NEUTRAL** (1.00–1.06×, ~1 % at M≥32 — dequant amortizes over M). And magic needs **FTZ → flushes E4M3 subnormals to 0** (LOSSY: ~0.5 max-abs vs the LUT over K=4096), which would break this path's bit-parity with the `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1` resident-bf16 prefill → the gather (lossless) correctly stays; the gated magic GEMM path was **reverted**. Bonus finding: **FP8→bf16 is LOSSLESS** (e4m3's ≤3 mantissa bits × pow2 E8M0 scale fit bf16's 7) → the GEMM is **relL2 3e-7 vs the f32 matvec ref** (f32-faithful, not merely argmax-exact) — so the −6 GB on-demand FP8 prefill is numerically ~identical to a resident-bf16 copy. Magic's real win is the **HBM-bound M=1 decode** matvec (lever E), not the GEMM.
  - **MXFP4 — NEW tile-dequant lever.** The expert GEMM (`matvec_mxfp4_8row_2x`, svtbl) is **dequant/issue-bound: FLAT ~84 Gmac/s from M=1 to M=64** (svtbl re-runs per token-pair, never amortizes), where FP8's tile-dequant scales 17→143. Added a gated **tile-dequant** path: dequant each 8-row group's nibbles **ONCE** (`svld1ub`→`svtbl`→×E8M0→bf16 L1 tile) and reuse across all M via the peak `8x3_pv` kernel. **LOSSLESS** (fp4×pow2 fits bf16 → relL2 **2e-7**, argmax-exact). Measured svtbl→tile: M=1 **0.33×** (tile loses — setup, no amortization), M=8 **1.08×** (crossover), **M=16 1.38× / M=32 1.53× / M=64 1.72×** (→147 Gmac/s, toward the bf16 compute peak). Gated `DS4F_MXFP4_GEMM_TILE` = **M-threshold** (default **0 = off**, keep svtbl which wins at M≤4; set ~8–16 to enable) — so it never regresses small M and is inert in production until enabled. Assumes vl==16 (A64FX SVE-512: each 16-elem chunk = lo/hi nibbles of one 32-block). **Real-weight 11n A/B — LANDED + VALIDATED (2026-06-08, alloc 49129596).** Batched-prefill perf (`REAL=1 EXACT=1`, MHC/Tier-B2 off — batched prefill is *disabled* under MHC/Tier-B2 so this synthetic-activation path on REAL MXFP4 bytes is the only vehicle; `FP8_BF16=1` dense, `PREFILL=512 PREFILL_BATCH=256`). **Token-EXACT:** argmax=108300 and prefill ‖x‖=7.626e+02 **bit-identical** across TILE∈{0,1,4,8,16} (6 runs), NaN=0, perf=11/11 lockstep — lossless on real weights at the activation-norm level, not just argmax. **Prefill +7.9%: 36.5 → 39.5 tok/s** (ms/tok 27.4→25.4, reproducible across repeat pairs), and **threshold-INSENSITIVE 1→16** (all give 25.3–25.4 ms/tok) ⇒ the compute-dominant experts carry **M≥16** in batched routing — *refuting the earlier "per-expert M may be small → neutral" caveat*. Comm% also fell 13→10 (faster expert-GEMM → less pre-all-reduce skew). Decode unchanged (18.95→18.92, expected — decode uses `mv_worker` not the GEMM path). **Recommended production setting: `DS4F_MXFP4_GEMM_TILE=16`** (full win; tiny-M experts stay on svtbl where single-node showed tile loses). *Regression check (single-node, alloc-free):* `ds4f_gemm_test` **205/205 OK** (BF16_PV/BF16/Q8_PV/FP8/MXFP4); `ds4f_exact_test` max-abs **5e-8** + `ds4f_tierb2_test` **2e-6** vs Python ref (header changes compile + forward math intact).

- **`kv_cache` window ring buffer — ctx ceiling ~255k → ~1M, the dominant long-ctx memory lever (Step 2p, automatic under tierb2, uncommitted).** This reframes the whole ctx-ceiling story and **supersedes int8 KV (2m) for ctx scaling.** *The discovery:* `kv_cache` was allocated at full `max_pos · kv_lora · 2B` for **all 43 layers** (`ds4f_impl.h:1852`), but under tierb2 **every layer reads `kv_cache` only over the last `window_size=128` positions** — sparse (ratio≠0) layers via `ds4f_attn_tb2_worker` (window term; older history is the compressed `cmp_kv`), and the 2 dense (ratio=0) layers via `ds4f_attn_exact_worker` (pure sliding window + sink). Nothing reads past the 128-window, so the full-`max_pos` allocation was **pure waste — ~44 GB/node at 1M ctx that was never read.** *The fix:* per-layer `ly->kv_slots = (tierb2 && !int8_kv) ? window_size : max_pos`, and index `kv_cache` everywhere as `(idx % kv_slots)` — sparse/dense layers ring-buffer to 128 slots; non-tierb2 / int8_kv keep `max_pos` (where `idx % max_pos == idx`, a **no-op ⇒ bit-exact**). Write `pos % kv_slots` (`forward_token`), read window `(p_lo+j) % kv_slots` (exact/tb2/prefill workers), `ds4f_warm_kv` fills only `min(npos, kv_slots)`. Gated on **tierb2** because the non-tierb2 synthetic path (`ds4f_attn_worker` full read) and batched-prefill (`ds4f_attn_pf_task`, needs all M positions) require the full buffer; batched prefill is anyway forced off under tierb2/MHC, and prefill is token-at-a-time → the ring holds each query's window. **`ds4f_arena_size` MUST mirror this** (added a `ring` param + per-layer kv sum) — the stale full-`max_pos` arena estimate (63 GB @1M) was itself the cause of a load-time OOM until fixed (→ **20.4 GB**). *Result:* `kv_cache` becomes a **constant ~5.6 MB** (43·128·512·2B) regardless of ctx — it **no longer scales**, so the only ctx-scaling caches left are `cmp_kv` (int8, 2,768 B/pos) + `idx_kv` (f32, 2,688 B/pos) → **slope 28.7 → ~5.5 KB/pos** (the int8-KV 21.5 KB/pos kv term vanishes entirely; **int8 KV / Lever B is now moot — the bf16 ring is strictly better than a half-`max_pos` int8 kv**). *Also found:* **`DS4F_IDX_INT8` (Lever F) is a memory *anti*-lever** — it keeps f32 `idx_kv` **and** adds a resident int8 mirror `idx_kv8` (+672 B/pos), so leave it **off** for memory (it's a speed experiment only). *Validation (NP=11, real weights, this alloc before it degraded):* **(a) bit-exactness** — real-weight gen A/B (149-tok prompt > 128 so prefill wraps the ring), ring (sparse-only, then ring-**all** incl. dense layers) is **TOKEN-IDENTICAL to HEAD** (byte-exact gen_ids, NaN=0, lockstep) — proves a pure storage relocation; **(b) memory** — `DS4F_CTX_WARM` MemFree sweep (FP8-on-demand + int8 cmp, **measure MemFree NOT RSS**): **262144 fits MemFree 6.24 GB, 524288 fits 4.15 GB** (ring-all), NaN=0, 11/11; **(c) 1M — CONFIRMED FIT (2026-06-08, alloc recycled by native re-stage).** `DS4F_CTX_WARM=1048576` warms all 43 layers (`warmtb2 DONE`, no ceiling hit) then decodes: **rc=0, 11/11, NaN=0, MemFree 2.45 GB / MemAvail 2.89 GB spare**, arena 20.4 GB, decode 1.60 tok/s (slow — memory-first). **Two-point slope CONFIRMED ~5.9 KB/pos** (524288 MemFree 5.56 GB, 1048576 MemFree 2.45 GB ⇒ 3.11/0.524M = 5.93 KB/pos) = cmp_q int8 2,768 + idx_kv f32 2,688 + s_idx_scores ~48 B/pos — exactly the traced per-pos allocs, **NO mystery extra**. (The earlier "~8 KB/pos / 2.5 KB extra" was a single-point error that folded the ~23.1 GB CONSTANT base — weights + off-arena compressor/indexer *weights* ~1 GB + OS — into the per-pos rate; the base is constant, identical at both points.) **Hard ceiling ~1.12M** (MemFree-2.0 floor), safe ~1.0M (1.5M OOMs). Single-node `ds4f_exact_test` 5e-8 / `ds4f_tierb2_test` 2e-6 unchanged. *Op note:* the alloc's PMIx/plexec was degraded earlier when a timed-out combined Bash job SIGKILL'd a mid-load 1M `mpiexec`; **recovered by a native re-stage** (`run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh`, a fresh `mpiexec` launch — no pjsub needed) which both refreshed `/local` and cleared the launch layer (smoke load=11/11 after). **NEXT for >1M — DONE (Step 2q):** `idx_kv` int8 replacement (`DS4F_IDX_INT8` made a true replacement) → 672 B/pos → slope **4.08 KB/pos → 1.5M CONFIRMED, hard ceiling ~1.58M**. (`s_idx_scores` is over-allocated at `n_threads·max_pos` vs the touched `max_pos/ratio` — ~150 MB, minor.) **12-node config: COUNTERPRODUCTIVE with a large controller reserve** — caches are replicated so the 12th node (node 0) adds no ctx capacity, only ~1 GB expert-shard saving; a 7 GB reserve makes node 0 the bottleneck (~455k, 3× worse than 11-node ~1.12M). 12-node helps only with a ≤~3 GB reserve (claude uses 0.44 GB) → ~1.25M, but needs a 12-way re-stage + an EP rank on claude's node. Then Phase 2 = context parallelism for *speed* at 1M.

- **idx_kv int8 REPLACEMENT — ctx ceiling ~1.12M → ~1.58M, real-weight token-identical (Step 2q, `DS4F_IDX_INT8`, uncommitted).** Turns the documented *anti-lever* into the real lever and is the natural follow-on to the kv_cache ring (2p). After the ring, `idx_kv` (f32, 2,688 B/pos) is the largest remaining ctx-scaling term (45% of the 5.93 KB/pos slope). The old `DS4F_IDX_INT8` was additive (kept f32 `idx_kv` AND added an int8 mirror `idx_kv8`, +672 B/pos = worse). *The fix, near-zero new code:* the f32 `idx_kv` scan (`ds4f_index_score`) runs **only for T < `DS4F_IDX_F32_SLOTS`=64** — for T≥64 the resident int8 `idx_kv8` svdot scan is used (the validated path) — so the f32 `idx_kv` needs only **64 slots**, not full `nslot`. Alloc shrinks f32 `idx_kv` to 64 slots when `idx_int8 && m->pool` (gated on pool so the int8 scan is guaranteed for T≥64); the write (`ds4f_index_step`) and the warm fill guard `slot < 64`. Net: `idx_kv` **2,688 → 672 B/pos** (the int8 mirror only), **slope 5.93 → ~4.08 KB/pos**. *Bit-identical-compute to the old additive idx_int8* (same int8 scan for T≥64, same f32 scan reading the same slots 0–63 for T<64) — only the unused f32 tail is freed → inherits its argmax-exact validation. *Validation (NP=11, real weights):* **(a) coherence** — gen A/B `DS4F_IDX_INT8=1` vs `=0`, 149-tok prompt + MAX_NEW=160 (total >256 so the int8 idx scan genuinely engages) is **TOKEN-IDENTICAL** (160/160, NaN=0, lockstep); **(b) memory** — 1M MemFree **2.45 → 4.45 GB (+2.0 GB**, exactly 2,016 B/pos × 1M), and **1,572,864 (1.5M) CONFIRMED FITS** (`warmtb2 DONE`, MemFree 2.31 GB, rc=0, 11/11, NaN=0); two-point slope 4.08 KB/pos ⇒ **hard ceiling ~1.58M**; **(c) regression** — idx_int8 OFF (default) `ds4f_exact_test` 5e-8 / `ds4f_tierb2_test` 2e-6 unchanged. Gated `DS4F_IDX_INT8` (default **off**). **Combined with the 2p ring: ctx 255k → ~1.5M (~6×) on the 11-node replicated design, memory-first, token-identical.** *Caveat:* needs the pooled int8 scan (always present in the EP runner; serial test path keeps full f32 idx_kv — inert there). NEXT: replicated-dense tensor-parallel (shard the ~8 GB dense, −7 GB/node) or Phase 2 context parallelism (shard KV → node count multiplies the ceiling + speeds the O(T) scan).

- **Tensor-parallel the REPLICATED dense weights — −4.2 GB/node, ctx ceiling ~1.58M → ~2.6M (Step 2r, `DS4F_TP_*`, committed `683cfaf`/`7961f1a`/`5614dea`).** The dense (MLA attn + shared + router + embed + head) is replicated on every EP node (the 240-vs-160 GB gap); after the ring (2p) + idx_kv (2q) ctx levers, it's the largest reclaimable per-node memory. Megatron-style col→row sharding across the 11 nodes, staged + env-gated (default off → inert), **FP8 dense required** (`DS4F_FP8_BF16=0`; Q8_PV 528 B groups unsliceable). Reuses the existing per-layer `ar_cb` all-reduce + a row-shard loader `ds4f_load_dense_vshard` (fp8→bf16 promote OR fp8/bf16 same-dtype, with a row offset); arena mirrors every shard. Stages, each real-weight A/B validated (NaN=0, lockstep):
  - **1 head vocab-shard (`DS4F_TP_HEAD`, −0.95 GB):** node holds head rows `[r·vocab/11..)`; decode head matvecs only its shard into `s_logits[head_r0..]`, zero-fills the rest, all-reduce-SUMS via `ar_cb` → full logits **BIT-EXACT** (disjoint shards + zeros sum exactly) → TOKEN-IDENTICAL. **embed** is the twin (`DS4F_TP_EMBED`, −0.97 GB): vocab-shard, `embed_lookup` zero-fills + owner copies its token's row + ar_cb-SUM → full embedding BIT-EXACT (TOKEN-IDENTICAL A/B).
  - **2 shared MLP (`DS4F_TP_SHARED`, −0.63 GB, ZERO extra comm):** `sh_w1/w3` col-parallel (shard `shared_inter`); swiglu local; `sh_w2` replicated contracts a ZERO-PADDED `s_shg` → partial shared, FOLDED into the existing routed-expert reduce (one all-reduce sums routed+shared). COHERENT (contraction shard → f32 reassoc, like the EP reduce; both completions sensible).
  - **3a attention wq_b (`DS4F_TP_ATTN`, −1.32 GB):** `wq_b` col-parallel **by head**; `ds4f_head_split` gives the q-norm/RoPE + attn workers the owned head range — **explicit range, NOT a zero-padded `s_q` (RMSNorm of a zero head → NaN)**; `s_attn` zeroed then only owned heads filled → `wo_a/wo_b` (replicated) on the partial → reduce the 4096 `s_o` (not 8192 `o_inter` — `wo_b` is linear). +1 all-reduce/layer. COHERENT.
  - **3b o-proj wo_a (`DS4F_TP_OPROJ`, −1.31 GB):** `wo_a` ROW-shard by `o_inter` (the clean alternative to the block-diagonal column-shard the 8-groups-∤-11 layout would force) — node holds `wo_a` rows `[oi0..)`, `ds4f_mv_bd_worker` gains a `goff` o_inter-offset so the group is `(goff+i)/o_lora` (shard need not align to groups). With TP_ATTN, `s_attn` is all-reduced to FULL first (head-partial + zeros → exact). `wo_b` replicated. COHERENT.
  - *Validation:* full stack (head+shared+attn+oproj) real-weight A/B on vs off — **COHERENT, NaN=0, lockstep, RSS 21.82 → 17.62 GB (−4.20 GB)**, GB/tok-weights 7.32→3.11. Regression (TP off) `ds4f_exact_test` 5e-8 / `ds4f_tierb2_test` 2e-6 unchanged. With embed added, only `wo_b` (1.4 GB, needs the strided o_inter column-shard) stays replicated; the dense TP stack (head+embed+shared+attn+oproj) frees **~5.2 GB/node** (arena 20.4→15.58 GB, RSS @short-ctx 21.83→17.62). **Ceiling CONFIRMED by ctx-warm MemFree sweep (full TP incl embed + int8 cmp/idx, FP8-on-demand): 2M fits MemFree 4.21 GB, 2.5M fits 2.44 GB, 2752512 (2.75M) fits MemFree 2.67 GB (all `warmtb2 DONE`, 11/11, NaN=0); 2949120 (2.9M) and 3145728 (3.1M) OOM at LOAD (rc=137).** ⇒ **full-TP ceiling ~2.75M confirmed** (cumulative ring(2p)+idx_kv(2q)+TP(2r): ~255k → ~2.75M, **~11×**, 11-node, memory-first).

A sub-mode of `int8_cmp` (reuses its calbuf/scales/exact-path/append-dispatch); `cmp_q4` is off-arena (no arena mirror). New SVE nibble-unpack kernels `ds4f_sve_dot_i4s`/`axpy_i4s` (`svld1ub` + lo/hi nibble + 4-bit sign-extend `(x^8)−8` + `svzip` back to channel order) + scalar fallbacks; `ds4f_cmp_{quant_row,freeze,append}_i4` mirror the int8 codec with `/7`. *Validation:* SVE-vs-scalar dot 4e-5 (FP reassoc) / axpy bit-identical; regression (off) 5e-8/2e-6 unchanged; **real-weight 11n gen A/B (full TP, FP8 dense, CAL=8 so the frozen int4 path runs through prefill+gen): int4 TOKEN-IDENTICAL to int8** (all 48 tokens, argmax 372, NaN=0, lockstep — the int4 latent error sits below the argmax-flip threshold, better than the predicted "coherent-not-identical"). Ceiling: 3670016 (3.5M) fits MemFree 3.68 GB, 4194304 (4M) fits MemFree 2.23 GB (`warmtb2 DONE`, 11/11, NaN=0) ⇒ **~4.2M**. **Cumulative ring(2p)+idx_kv(2q)+TP(2r)+int4_cmp(2s): ~255k → ~4.2M (~16×)**, 11-node, memory-first.

- **Step 2t — int4 `idx_kv8` indexer cache (`DS4F_IDX_INT4`, default off, commit `23b793b`): ceiling ~4.2M → ~4.8M.** The last per-pos scaler after int4 cmp. `idx_kv8` (672 B/pos) → `idx_kv8_4` = 2 signed-nibbles/byte (±7, per-position scale `/7`) = **336 B/pos**. Sub-mode of `DS4F_IDX_INT8` (reuses the f32-shrink-to-64-slots + resident-scan infra). Unlike cmp (f32 q · int8 k), the indexer scan is a **symmetric int8×int8 `svdot`** (`ds4f_idxsc8r_worker`); int4 keeps the int8 query and **unpacks each position's int4 key → int8 temp** (hd=128 ops, amortized over H=64 heads ≈ 6%) then reuses `svdot` (new `ds4f_idxsc8r4_worker` + `ds4f_idx_quant_pos_i4`). `index_step` gains an `idx_kv8_4` param; the f32-shrink gate, write, scan dispatch, and synthetic warm all branch on it. *Validation:* regression (off) 5e-8/2e-6 unchanged; **real-weight 11n gen A/B (full TP + int4 cmp, ~270-tok prompt so the gen runs at T=67–81 > `DS4F_IDX_F32_SLOTS`=64 ⇒ int4 idx scan engaged throughout): TOKEN-IDENTICAL to int8 idx** (56/56 tokens, argmax 447, NaN=0, lockstep — int4 per-position quant flips zero top-k selections). **Cumulative 2p+2q+2r+2s+2t: ~255k → ~4.8M (~19×)** (combined int4 cmp+idx slope ~1.72 KB/pos); confirm via ctx-warm sweep.

## Phase 2 — sharded-KV context parallelism (CP, `DS4F_CP`): shard the compressed caches across nodes

After 2p–2t the only per-pos state left is the compressed caches `cmp_q4` (1384) + `idx_kv8_4` (336) = **~1720 B/pos**, still REPLICATED on every node. CP shards *those* by compressed-slot range across the N=11 nodes ⇒ memory/node ÷N (ceiling toward tens of millions, then bound by per-node constants ≈ arena 15.6 GB + window + 64-slot f32-idx) AND the O(T) indexer scan ÷N. The window (`kv_cache`, 128-slot ring, ~5.6 MB constant) is NOT a scaler → stays replicated. Decode-only (batched prefill stays single-node, like mHC/tierb2). Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/see-a64fx-ds4f-md-and-keep-floofy-dragon.md`.

**Why online-softmax-combine (not gather-selected):** CSA (ratio=4) attends the indexer top-512; HCA (ratio=128) attends ALL T compressed (`ds4f_impl.h` ~:3079). Gathering selected rows works for CSA's 512 but explodes for HCA (millions). The unified mechanism is flash-attention's **online-softmax-combine**: each node attends only the slots it OWNS into a partial `{m,l,acc}`, then nodes combine (one MAX-reduce + one SUM-reduce per layer, ~131 KB, no latent gather). The current single-pass softmax in `ds4f_attn_tb2_worker` (`ds4f_impl.h` ~:3265-3289) already computes `{m,l,acc}`.

- **Stage A — DONE, committed `1f7d46a`.** `tp_allreduce_max` (`tp_allreduce.h`) clones the sum's recursive-doubling schedule with an element-wise-max recv (`tp_ar_recv_max`); MAX is exact (result is one of the inputs ⇒ no bf16 round-trip needed ⇒ deterministic ⇒ lockstep-safe), mirroring the existing `tp_allreduce_argmax`. `ep_armax_callback` + `m->ar_max_cb`/`ar_max_ctx` wired like `ar_cb`. `DS4F_CP_SELFTEST` (gated, kept as CP regression gate). *Validated 11-node:* all ranks `tp_allreduce_max PASS bad=0 worst=0.000e+00` (correct vs serial max, bitwise-exact, lockstep); inference ran 11/11 afterward (max-reduce coexists with sum-reduces — shared `seq` stays aligned).

- **Stage B — slot-shard the compressed caches + sharded indexer scan + top-k merge (the memory-win piece).**
  1. `ds4f_cp_slot_shard(S, ep_rank, ep_size, &s0, &s1)` (S = `max_pos/ratio` per layer); node r owns compressed slots `[s0,s1)`. Per-layer `cp_s0/cp_s1` (off ⇒ `[0,S)`); global slot g → local `g−s0` when owned.
  2. **Alloc** (`ds4f_impl.h` ~:1781 cmp, ~:1864 idx): size `cmp_q4`/`idx_kv8_4` to `(s1−s0)` slots, not full `nslot` — **this is the memory drop** (~1720 → ~156 B/pos/node). `cmp_scale`/`idx_pscale` self-calibrated per node from its own slots; the combine carries **dequantized bf16** latents and comparable **f32** scores ⇒ no cross-node scale-consistency constraint.
  3. **Write/warm** (~:1535 write, ~:3572 warm): a node quantizes/fills slot only if `s0 ≤ slot < s1`; decode-write only the owner of the newest slot.
  4. **Sharded scan + top-k merge** (`ds4f_index_step` ~:1524): each node runs `ds4f_idxsc8r4_worker` over its owned slots → local top-`min(512,owned)` `{global_slot,score}`; zero-fill an `[N·512]` buffer at the node's segment + `ar_cb`-SUM (= gather, the TP head trick — no new collective) → merge via `ds4f_index_topk` → global top-512; each node keeps the subset in its `[s0,s1)`.
  - *Validatable standalone* with `DS4F_CP_VERIFY`: all-gather the full caches and check the merged top-512 == the replicated-path selection (coherent before Stage C lands).

- **Stage C — online-softmax-combine attention (CSA + HCA) + window owner.**
  1. **Partial attention** (refactor `ds4f_attn_tb2_worker` ~:3239): per head compute `m_h`=max, `l_h`=Σexp(score−m_h), `acc_h[hd]`=Σ(exp/·)·value over the slots this node OWNS (CSA: its share of `sel[]`; HCA: all its `[s0,s1)`). The **window owner** (rank owning the newest slots) also folds the replicated 128-window + `attn_sink[h]`; a rank owning nothing emits `m=−1e30, l=0, acc=0` (not `−inf`, to keep the exp arithmetic finite).
  2. **Combine** (in `ds4f_forward_token` ~:4109 after the attn dispatch): `ar_max_cb(m,H)`→global `m`; each node `s=exp(m_local−m_global)`, `l*=s`, `acc*=s`; `ar_cb([l (H) | acc (H·hd)])` SUM→global; `out_h=acc_h/l_h` ⇒ full `s_attn` identical on all ranks (lockstep). De-rotate (~:3314) after combine; o-proj (optionally TP) proceeds unchanged.
  3. **Guards**: abort batched prefill under CP; composes with full TP + int4 cmp/idx (all default-off, orthogonal). **Combine determinism** = lockstep: MAX exact, SUM bf16-identical, `exp` on the same global `m` everywhere. **Window double-count**: exactly one contributor (assert).
  - *Gate:* real-weight gen A/B `DS4F_CP=1` vs off, ≥270-tok prompt, MAX_NEW≥48 → **coherent, NaN=0, lockstep** (reassociates ⇒ coherent not bit-exact, the TP/EP standard). Then ctx-warm MemFree sweep probing past 4.8M (6M, 8M).

### Decode tok/s — roofline & the path to ≥20 (current ~13 @10k, ~0.8–1.2 @1M+)
Optimized decode @ctx10240 = **13.03 tok/s = 76.7 ms/tok**. Per-phase (Step 2l breakdown) and whether it **amortizes under M>1** (batched/speculative decode):

| phase | ms | amortizes (M>1)? | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| comm (43 EP all-reduces) | 12.7 | **yes ÷M** | latency-bound 296 µs/16 KB Put — fewer reduces/token |
| qkv+o_proj+shared+experts (weight matvecs) | 27.5 | **yes (GEMM)** | M>1 ⇒ dequant-once-per-tile reused (MXFP4 tile 1.5–1.7× @M16-32; int8 dense) |
| attn (window+selected) | 13.8 | no | per-position; SVE, L2-resident, near floor |
| tb2prep (lcmp/topk/scan/qproj) | 17.5 | no (scan part shards under **CP**) | per-position; partly O(T) |
| misc | ~5 | — | |

- **Absolute BW floor** (weights only): ~2.9 GB/tok/node ÷ ~720 GB/s ≈ **4 ms ⇒ ~250 tok/s** — decode is NOWHERE near BW-bound; it is **comm-latency + dequant-issue + per-position-attn bound**.
- **Amortizable** (comm + weight matvecs) = 12.7 + 27.5 = **40.2 ms**; **non-amortizable** (per-position attn + tb2prep) = 13.8 + 17.5 = **31.3 ms** ⇒ even with perfect M-batching the single-stream floor is **~31 ms ≈ 32 tok/s**.
- **≥20 tok/s IS achievable — via speculative decode (the math):** draft K + verify-in-one-pass (M=K). At K≈3 accepted: comm 12.7→**4.2** ms/tok (÷3), the 27.5 ms weight matvecs become an M=3 GEMM (dequant amortized ~1.4× ⇒ ≈**12.8** ms/tok), attn+tb2 stay 31.3 (per-position) ⇒ **≈48 ms = ~20.7 tok/s**. Batched **multi-sequence** decode (B=8–32) reaches similar/higher **aggregate throughput** (comm+matvec fully amortize; per-sequence attn/tb2 scale with B). Both need packed-B GEMM (note the known A64FX batched-prefill regression, `project_batched_prefill`).
- **Ceiling ~32 tok/s** (the per-position attn+tb2 floor). To beat it: cut attn (near floor already) or tb2's O(T) scan — which is exactly what **CP shards at high ctx**, so CP also *preserves* ~20–30 tok/s at 1M+ where decode is otherwise ~1 tok/s (scan-bound). **Net: spec/batched decode gets to ~20–30 tok/s; CP keeps it there at long ctx.**

### Resuming prompt — Phase 2 CP (next session)
> **TASK: DS4F sharded-KV context parallelism (`DS4F_CP`).** Stage A DONE+committed (`1f7d46a`): `tp_allreduce_max` (`tp_allreduce.h`) + `ep_armax_callback`/`m->ar_max_cb` (`ds4f_ep_runner.c`) + `DS4F_CP_SELFTEST` — validated 11-node (all ranks PASS bad=0 worst=0). **NEXT = Stage B** (slot-shard `cmp_q4`/`idx_kv8_4` by `[s0,s1)`, sharded `ds4f_idxsc8r4_worker` scan, top-k merge via zero-fill+`ar_cb`-SUM), then **Stage C** (partial `{m,l,acc}` refactor of `ds4f_attn_tb2_worker` + the combine `ar_max_cb`(m)+`ar_cb`([l|acc]) in `ds4f_forward_token`). Full design + file:line in the plan file `~/.claude/plans/see-a64fx-ds4f-md-and-keep-floofy-dragon.md` and the "Phase 2" section above.
> **Standing rules:** native fcc/FCC; in-alloc `mpiexec` (no pjsub) NP=11 EXCLUDE node 0; **measure MemFree not RSS**; validate coherence/lockstep (NOT bit-exact — combine reassociates); FP8 dense (`DS4F_FP8_BF16=0`) required; CP composes with full TP (`DS4F_TP_*`) + int4 cmp/idx (`DS4F_INT4_CMP`/`DS4F_IDX_INT4`), all default-off; commit only when asked; one real-weight gen per Bash call (batched jobs blow the 10-min timeout → SIGKILL degrades PMIx → recover via native re-stage `run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh`).
> **Cumulative ceiling: ~255k → ~4.8M (~19×)** committed (2p `981350a`, 2q `cc86b0f`, 2r `683cfaf`/`7961f1a`/`5614dea`/`2c00f58`, 2s `f9fb3ff`, 2t `23b793b`); CP targets tens-of-millions + ~20–30 tok/s at long ctx (see roofline above — spec/batched decode is the speed lever, CP shards the O(T) scan that otherwise caps long-ctx decode at ~1 tok/s).

## Prefill throughput → 200+ tok/s (11–12 nodes): roofline + plan

Batched prefill (Step 2o, `DS4F_PREFILL_BATCH` + MXFP4 tile-dequant) = **~39.5 tok/s** real-weight 11-node (2.3× over token-at-a-time 17.27). Roofline below: the wall is the **replicated dense** (batched prefill *aborts under TP*, so every node recomputes the full dense — ~59% of cluster prefill wall = qkv 19% + o_proj 29% + shared 11%; **attention is only 3.9%** at the cluster, so "attention-as-GEMM" is NOT the lever — the old 37% was a single-node synthetic config).

### Peak prefill tok/s — the math
A64FX fp32-FMA peak = **6.14 TFLOP/s = 3.07 Tmac/s per node** (48 cores × 16 fp32 × 2 pipes × 2 FMA × 2.0 GHz; ×1.1 @2.2 GHz boost). fp16-accumulate doubles it (`a64fx/doc/FP16_GEMM_CEILING.md`: a tuned fp16 12×2 kernel hits **89% of the 256 GF/core peak** L1-resident).

Per-token macs/node (dims C=4096, q_lora=1024, n_heads·q_head_dim=32768, o_inter=8192, shared_inter=2048, moe_inter=2048, n_active≈8, 43 layers):
- **Dense (REPLICATED on every node)**: qkv_b 33.6M + wo_a 33.6M + wo_b 33.6M + shared 25.2M + qkv_a/kv/router ≈ **133M/layer × 43 ≈ 5.7 Gmac/token**.
- **Routed experts (EP-sharded /11)**: ≈ **1.05 Gmac/token/node**. Head (TP) ≈0.05; attention ≈0.7 (only 3.9% of wall).
- **Total ≈ 6.8 Gmac/token/node — of which 5.7 (84%) is REDUNDANT dense.**

| scenario | macs/tok/node | FMA ceiling tok/s (11n, fp32, 100%) | at current ~7% GEMM util |
|---|---|---|---|
| **today** (dense replicated, no TP) | 6.8 G | **~451** | ~32 (≈ measured 39.5) |
| **+ TP dense** (shard 5.7→0.52 G) | **1.6 G** | **~1920** | **~140–170** |
| + TP + fp16-accum | 1.6 G | ~3840 | ~280 |

**Findings:**
- The **replicated dense hard-caps prefill at ~451 tok/s** even at 100% FMA util ⇒ 200 tok/s (44% of that) is unreachable without a near-peak kernel. **Sharding the dense (TP) lifts the ceiling to ~1920** ⇒ 200 tok/s = ~10% util, easily reachable.
- Current ~39.5 tok/s ≈ **7% of FMA peak** ⇒ the `8x3_pv` GEMM microkernel is far from the 89% a tuned A64FX kernel reaches — the second lever.
- **12 nodes barely helps prefill while dense is replicated** (the 5.7 G term doesn't shard); the 12th node is a real **+9% only after TP-compose** (then dense shards /12).

### Levers (priority order)
1. **(dominant) Compose TP-dense with batched prefill.** `DS4F_TP_*` (Step 2r) shard the dense on the *decode* path only; batched prefill aborts under TP. Wire the shard ranges (`attn_h0/h1`, `oi0/oi_rows`, `sh_r0/sh_rows`, `head_r0`) + `ds4f_load_dense_vshard` into `ds4f_forward_prefill` (M as the GEMM outer dim); the existing per-layer `[M,C]` `ar_cb`-SUM already folds the contraction-shard reduce. Drops per-node dense macs 5.7→0.52 G ⇒ ceiling 451→~1920; **at current GEMM util ≈ 140–170 tok/s (3.5–4×) by itself**, and makes the 12th node worth +9%. Bit-exact for disjoint shards (head/embed), coherent for contraction shards (attn/o-proj/shared) — Step-2r standard.
2. **Tighten the bf16/fp16 GEMM microkernel** (~7% → 20–40% of FMA peak). Port the `FP16_GEMM_CEILING.md` 89%-of-peak 12×2 register-blocking (4K-unroll, no-epilogue-convert) into the dense prefill GEMM; larger K-tile/M-block for L1/L2 weight residence. 3–4× → **>200 tok/s** combined with Lever 1. (Experts MXFP4 are only ~5% of wall — low priority; int8-svdot experts if needed.)
3. **(optional) fp16-accumulate GEMM** — doubles the FMA ceiling; gate behind a real-weight **argmax-exact** A/B (fp16 accum is lossy — may flip argmax, like the Step-2o magic/FTZ check). Only to exceed ~280 tok/s.

**Target:** Lever 1 → ~140–170; +Lever 2 → **>200**; +Lever 3 → ~280+. (Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/see-a64fx-ds4f-md-and-keep-floofy-dragon.md`.)

- **`TP_AR_BF16` REFUTED (negative result, not adopted).** Tested whether halving the EP all-reduce
  payload (f32 → bf16) cuts the ≈12.7 ms "other"/comm. It does **not**: comm dropped only **2.5 %**
  (confirming the reduce is **latency/sync-bound, not payload-bound**) while argmax flipped 294 → 58
  (bf16-rounding the reduce → not bit-exact). Also clarified the comm structure: the two `ar_cb` call
  sites (`ds4f_impl.h:3393` PREFILL `[M,C]` and `:3570` DECODE `s_route[C]`) are **separate
  prefill-vs-decode paths, NOT two reduces per pass** — decode is **one** all-reduce per layer × 43,
  and layer N+1 needs layer N's reduced output (a hard sequential dependency in autoregressive M=1),
  so the earlier "fuse the two per-layer reduces" idea was a misread and there is nothing to fuse. The
  only real comm lever is cutting the *number of tokens-worth* of reduces = **batched / speculative
  decode** (item 3), which is architectural.

## Remaining work (priority order)

### Remaining perf levers at a glance (post-2l, decode 13.03 tok/s @ctx10240)

After six landed levers (2g–2l) decode is IN the 10–15 target band and every
**single-phase serial/NUMA artifact is fixed**. The honest verdict: **pure
decode-speed levers at ≤16k ctx are essentially exhausted** — the big remaining
phases (comm, tb2prep, attn) are all *fundamental* (latency-bound / already-pooled
/ near roofline). The real remaining gains are **structural** (batched decode, A)
and **at higher ctx, unlocked by memory** (int8 KV, B / int8 index scan, F).

1. **`o_proj`/q-norm/tb2rope FIXED (2i+2j+2k) + int8 W8A8 dense (2l). New @ctx10240 breakdown**
   (decode **13.03 tok/s**): **other 12.7 (≈comm, now the biggest)**, attn 13.8, **tb2prep 17.5**
   [lcmp 4.6 / topk 4.2 / scan 3.6 / qproj 3.2 / icmp 1.3 / rope 0.24], o_proj 9.4 (was 11.6 bf16),
   qkv_proj 7.5 [`wq_b` 4.0 + wq_a 0.9 + wkv 0.7 + rope 0.44] (halved by int8), shared 6.1, experts
   4.5. The three serial-scalar artifacts (o-proj NUMA, q-norm, tb2rope) are fixed AND the dense
   matvecs are now int8 (half HBM). The remaining big phases are **fundamental**: **(a) comm ≈12.7 ms**
   = 43 per-layer EP all-reduces, ~296 µs each for a 16 KB Put → **latency/sync-bound, NOT
   payload-bound — `TP_AR_BF16` REFUTED** (ran it: comm −2.5 % only, argmax flipped 294→58; the real
   fix is reducing the *number* of reduces = batched decode, item 3 — see Step 2l note above); **(b)
   tb2prep residue** (lcmp/topk/scan/qproj) all already pooled or already-O(T·log k), partly ctx-linear
   (now the single biggest phase); **(c) attn 13.8 ms** SVE-vectorized, L2-resident — near its floor.
   *Note:* under `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1` (the longctx-runner default) the dense matvecs are bf16-pv (or int8
   with `DS4F_Q8_DENSE=1`), not FP8 — the magic/gather question only applies to the memory-lean
   `DS4F_FP8_BF16=0` path.
   - *Done & shelved:* **int8/SVE `index_score` scan** (`DS4F_IDX_INT8`, `ae1167d`). argmax-exact
     (96/96), f32 path bit-identical, gated default-off, but zero ≤16k decode win (Amdahl 1.2 % +
     M=1 q-quant cancellation). Keep as the 256k building block.
2. **256k decode without degradation (10–15 tok/s)** — the original long-ctx target. The
   **MEMORY ceiling is now essentially CLEARED** (measured ~255k with the int8 stack below);
   speed at long ctx remains the open blocker. Both characterized:
   - **Memory — MEASURED CEILING ~255k (was thought 32k).** The combined int8 stack
     **FP8-on-demand dense (`DS4F_FP8_BF16=0`) + int8 KV (2m) + int8 cmp_kv (2n)** reaches a
     hard ceiling **~255k** (safe ~242k), a ~8× jump. Path: FP8-on-demand+int8-KV alone = ~200k
     (131072 fits w/ 4.65 GB MemFree spare); int8 cmp_kv adds +1.05 GB @131072 → ~255k. **MEASURE
     VIA MemFree, NEVER RSS** — `cmp_kv`/`idx_kv` are THP-backed, costing real physical memory but
     invisible to `/proc/self/statm` (2.72 GB physical @131072, zero RSS delta). The next mem lever
     for a robust 262144 margin is **int8 `idx_kv`** (lever B3, slope → 26.6, ceiling → ~270k+).
     Clean-exit ceiling guard (`DS4F_WARM_MEMAVAIL_STOP_GB` → `_exit(42)`) makes ctx-probing on a
     shared alloc PMIx-safe (rc=42 not OOM-kill 137). *(Historical:* bf16 KV alone (Step 2e) was
     not enough — ctx=32768 OOM'd because the 27.5 GB replicated dense weights, inflated +6 GB by
     `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1`, dominate, not KV.*)*
     - **int8 W8A8 dense (Step 2l, `DS4F_Q8_DENSE`, commit `99b76ad`) takes RSS
     27.95 → 22.40 GB (−5.5 GB) AND speeds decode +9.7 %** (token-identical) — the SPEED+memory int8
     lever (pairs with FP8-on-demand for the pure-memory path). int8 dense + int8 KV + int8 cmp_kv
     clears 32K–256K; the remaining gate/head are still bf16 (argmax protection).
     **PARTIALLY LANDED: int8 W8A8 dense (Step 2l, `DS4F_Q8_DENSE`, commit `99b76ad`) takes RSS
     27.95 → 22.40 GB (−5.5 GB) AND speeds decode +9.7 %** (token-identical) — the first "int8
     weights" step toward 256k. **Retest ctx=32768 with `DS4F_Q8_DENSE=1` on a FRESH alloc** (NOT a
     shared alloc — an OOM-kill degrades PMIx, see Step 2e OPS note). Other levers: `DS4F_FP8_BF16=0`
     (FP8 dense, −6 GB, slower — now dominated by int8 W8A8 which is −5.5 GB AND faster) and **int8
     KV** (quarter the f32 footprint). int8 dense + int8 KV should clear 32K–64K; 256k needs the
     remaining dense int8 (gate/head still bf16) too.
     *int8-KV scheme de-risked* (`tools/int8kv_probe.c`, single-process, no alloc): the kv
     latent's massive-activation channels (~1e3–1e5, the same ones that forced bf16-not-fp16)
     make naive **per-token int8 catastrophic** (one sink dim sets the scale → 99 % of the
     O(1) dims collapse to 0). The viable layout is a **static per-channel scale calibrated
     on the first ~256 positions** (S5): L1-rel 0.0032 ≈ bf16, only 2.7 % of |·|>0.1 dims
     >5 % off, and **streaming-decode-compatible** (sink channels are positionally consistent,
     so early calibration holds for all later positions). 1 B/elem (+ a 512-float per-layer
     per-channel scale, amortized). NOTE: probe uses a *representative synthetic* latent
     distribution — the per-channel scheme + calibration window still need argmax-exact
     confirmation on real latents (alloc-blocked). Implementation: `kv_cache` uint16→int8 +
     `kv_scale[layer][512]` (calibrate during prefill/warm), dequant at the latent-read sites.
   - **Speed:** after `index_topk` (2g) + SVE-attn (2h) + fused o-proj (2i) + parallel q-norm (2j) +
     parallel tb2rope (2k) + int8 W8A8 dense (2l) decode is **13.03 tok/s @ctx10240** — IN the 10–15
     target band — bound by comm + tb2 residue + attn (see item 1, all now fundamental). At 256k the
     index *scan* additionally grows to dominate — int8/SVE `index_score`
     (done, `ae1167d`) is the 256k prerequisite but does not move ≤16k.
3. **Batched decode / prefill M > 1** — amortize the 43 per-layer EP all-reduces
   (comm ~20 % Amdahl floor at M=1). Needs packed-B GEMM kernels; note the known A64FX
   batched-prefill regression (`project_batched_prefill_finding`).
4. **fp4 compressor/indexer weights** — LOSSY, low value (the bf16 weights are already
   bit-exact and the `index_score`/RoPE/fp4 overhead, not the weights, is the `tb2prep`
   floor). Only if HBM pressure justifies.

## Next session — resuming prompt

> **CURRENT TASK (2026-06-08): direct MXFP4/FP8 GEMM register-dequant — DONE + real-weight VALIDATED (Step 2o).**

> FP8→bf16 is lossless), so the gather stays and the register-magic GEMM path was reverted (magic+FTZ is
> lossy: flushes E4M3 subnormals). The **MXFP4 GEMM tile-dequant** lever (`DS4F_MXFP4_GEMM_TILE`=M-thr,
> default off) is LANDED: svtbl expert GEMM is dequant-bound (flat ~84 Gmac/s); tile-dequant nibbles→bf16
> once + reuse across M = **1.38× @M16 / 1.53× @M32 / 1.72× @M64** (single-node, lossless relL2 2e-7).

> **NEXT (still open):** lever E real-weight argmax for FP8 magic **decode** (M=1, the actual on-register
> win — distinct from the GEMM). Entry points: `ds4f_gemm_worker` MXFP4 tile branch (`ds4f_impl.h`, gated

>    output (hard sequential dep in M=1, nothing to fuse). The only real lever is cutting the *number

> 2. **tb2prep residue (lcmp 4.6 / topk 4.2 / scan 3.6 / qproj 3.2 = the single biggest phase now).**
>    All already pooled (lcmp/qproj/scan matvecs) or already-O(T·log k) (topk), partly ctx-linear.

>    −5.5 GB is the first int8-weights step toward the 32768/256k OOM ceiling (resident dense weights,
