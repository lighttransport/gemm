# DeepSeek-V4-Flash (DS4F) on 11× A64FX (Fugaku) — build & run repro

EP-only inference harness for DeepSeek-V4-Flash (284B total / 13B activated MoE,
43 MoE layers, hidden 4096, vocab 129280). 256 routed experts are EP-sharded
~23–24/node; dense (attn / shared expert / router / embed / head) is replicated and
computed redundantly per node. Weights stay quantized in HBM with on-demand dequant
(dense FP8 e4m3fn, experts MXFP4) to fit ~25 GB usable HBM2/node.

This file is the **operational repro** for the real-weight Tier-B1 run. The science /
status lives in the auto-memory `project_ds4f_flash_ep_harness`; the design rationale
in `~/.claude/plans/plan-deepseek-v4-flash-iterative-prism.md`.

## TL;DR

```sh
# inside a live 12-node alloc (shape 2x3x2), from a64fx/llm:
./run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh                          # 1. shard weights -> each node's /local (~22 GB/node)
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_EXACT=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh        # 2. exact Tier-B1 forward on the 11 EP nodes
```

Both launchers default to `NP=11`, `EXCLUDE=0,0,0` (drops the claude/login-colocated
node), and regenerate `vcoord_ds4f.txt` + the Tofu topology for the *current* alloc.
Last validated (job 49092345, 2026-06-05): `rc=0`, NaNs=0, argmax=122293,
prefill 10.44 / decode 10.16 tok/s, arena 22.18 / RSS 21.81 GB/node.

## Files (branch `ds4f`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `common/ds4f.h` | self-contained model: config / alloc / forward / loaders / dequant matvecs |
| `a64fx/llm/ds4f_runner.c` | single-node driver (no uTofu) — validation vehicle |
| `a64fx/llm/ds4f_ep_runner.c` | 11-node uTofu EP driver (links `-ltofucom`) |
| `a64fx/llm/ds4f_stage.c` | sharded safetensors → per-node `/local/ds4f/rank<rr>.blob` stager |
| `a64fx/llm/run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh` | stage launcher (mpiexec, PMIX_RANK self-ID) |
| `a64fx/llm/run_ds4f_11n.sh` | run launcher (vcoord + topo + mpiexec) |
| `a64fx/utofu-tests/tofu_topo_helper` | MPI program that writes `tofu_topo.txt` (rank→coords) |

Build is native `fcc`/`FCC` (NOT `fccpx`/`FCCpx`); binaries run directly, **no `pjsub`**
for the run itself (this is a native A64FX node). The launchers rebuild the runner via
`make ds4f_ep_runner CC=fcc OPENMP=1`.

## Prerequisites

- A live allocation: `pjsub -L "node=12,..."` shape **2×3×2** (12 nodes; 1 is the
  claude/login node, excluded → 11 EP nodes). Confirm with `env | grep PJM_MPI_SHAPE`
  (`X=2 Y=3 Z=2`) and `echo $PJM_SUBJOBID`.
- Real weights at `$HOME/models/ds4f` (config.json + 46 safetensors shards).
- PATH must **PREPEND** `/opt/local/mpiexec:/opt/FJSVxtclanga/tcsds-1.2.43/bin` (the
  launchers do this) so `mpiclang` (for the topo helper) and `fcc` both stay resolvable.

## Step 1 — stage weights to node-local `/local`

```sh
cd a64fx/llm
DS4F_STAGE_FLUSH_GB=2 ./run_ds4f_stage_11n.sh
```

Each rank self-identifies via `PMIX_RANK` (own_mpi exports it to non-MPI binaries) and
streams **only its owned tensors** (dense → all ranks; expert `e` → rank `e%11`) file→file
from the read-only safetensors mmap into `/local/ds4f/rank<rr>.blob` + a text manifest.
RSS stays ~tens of MB (it is NOT loading weights). `DS4F_STAGE_FLUSH_GB=2` bounds the
HBM `/local` dirty-page cache (fdatasync + `fadvise(DONTNEED)` every 2 GB) — without it
the blob's dirty pages pile up in HBM (~7 GB) and OOM-segfault the stage.

Done signal: 11× `a64fx/llm/ds4f_stage_rank*.txt` on the shared FS. ~1270 s wall
(shared-FS read-bound, ~22 GB/node). The launcher prints `OK: all 11 ranks staged`.

## Step 2 — run the exact Tier-B1 forward

```sh
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_EXACT=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh
```

The launcher: regenerates `vcoord_ds4f.txt` (excludes relative `(0,0,0)`), runs
`tofu_topo_helper` → `a64fx/llm/tofu_topo.txt` for **this** alloc, builds the runner,
then `mpiexec -np 11 -vcoordfile vcoord_ds4f.txt build/ds4f_ep_runner`. Each rank mmaps
its `/local` blob, copies tensors into a ~22 GB arena (FP8 e4m3fn dense + MXFP4 expert
nibble-repack), and runs prefill 8 + decode 16. Output: per-rank
`ds4f_ep_{perf,load}_rank*.txt` + `ds4f_ep_rank00.txt` summary.

`DS4F_REAL=1` pins dense to FP8 (real e4m3fn bytes). `DS4F_EXACT=1` swaps the dense
stand-ins for the exact DeepSeek math (RoPE/YaRN, per-head q-norm, MQA sliding-window +
sink attn, grouped low-rank o-proj, sqrtsoftplus gate, swiglu clamp); `exact=0` is
byte-identical to the stand-in path.

## Step 2b — Tier-B2 (compressor/indexer) real-weight run

```sh
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_TIERB2=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh      # implies EXACT; reuses the SAME blobs
```

No re-stage needed: the compressor/indexer tensors (`layers.L.attn.compressor.*`,
`.indexer.*`) are classified `CLS_DENSE` by the stager, so they are already in every
rank's `/local` blob. `ds4f_load_real` loads them by name and widens to f32 at load
time (BF16→f32 for the compressor/`weights_proj`/indexer-compressor weights, FP8
e4m3fn + E8M0 128² dequant for `indexer.wq_b`, F32 `ape` + BF16 `norm` direct). The
forward then runs the stateful 21-CSA + 20-HCA compressor/indexer path.

Validated (job 49092345, 2026-06-05): `rc=0`, 11/11, **NaNs=0**, argmax=98198
(lockstep), RSS 21.82 GB/node. **Perf:** decode 0.56 / prefill 0.60 tok/s — attention
is 94.8 % because the f32 compressor/indexer matvecs are pure overhead at short ctx
(prefill 8 + decode 16 = 24 positions). Tier-B2 only amortizes past ~`index_topk=512`
context (its point is O(topk) long-context attention); the kernels are f32 reference
implementations, not yet SVE/quant-optimized (the speed follow-up).

## Step 2c — real-weight bf16-pv dense promote (fast decode)

```sh
DS4F_REAL=1 DS4F_FP8_BF16=1 ./run_ds4f_11n.sh    # predequant replicated dense FP8 -> bf16-pv
```

No re-stage needed (same FP8 blobs). At load, the 9 replicated dense tensors (`head`,
attn `wq_a/wq_b/wkv/wo_a/wo_b`, router `gate`, shared-expert `sh_w1/w3/w2`) are requant'd
FP8→bf16 in the pair-interleaved `BF16_PV` layout via `ds4f_load_dense`; routed experts
stay MXFP4. **FP8→bf16 is lossless** (e4m3's 3-bit mantissa × 2^k block scale fits bf16's
7 mantissa bits with no rounding) ⇒ a pure speed win, no accuracy cost. The default
(no `DS4F_FP8_BF16`) takes the same-dtype fast path and is byte-identical to the FP8 run.
Set `DS4F_BF16_PV=0` to force plain (non-pv) bf16. Costs ~+6 GB (FP8 ~12 GB dense → bf16
~18 GB); safe at the harness's short ctx, watch the budget past ~8 K (the +6 GB pushes a
128 K KV cache over HBM).

Validated (reused `/local` blobs, EXCLUDE=0,0,0, prefill 8 + decode 16): `rc=0`, 11/11,
**NaNs=0**, argmax=60574 (lockstep), RSS **27.50 GB/node** (arena 26.02 GB, fits < 32 GB
HBM2). **Perf:** decode **16.73 tok/s** (+65 % over FP8's 10.16) / prefill **17.27**
(+63 % over 10.60) — near the synthetic bf16-pv 17.49 ceiling. The profile flips to
matvec-bound (o_proj 29 % + qkv 19 % + shared 11 %); comm ~20 % is the EP all-reduce
Amdahl floor (same as synthetic). MXFP4-dense is NOT promotable from real FP8 (lossy) —
`ds4f_load_dense` aborts on an MXFP4 dense dest.

## OPS gotchas (each cost a real cycle)

1. **A job restart wipes `/local` AND moves the alloc.** A new `pjsub`/restart →
   new `$PJM_SUBJOBID` →
   - `/local` is cleared → the staged blobs are GONE → `DS4F_REAL=1` opens a missing
     `/local/ds4f/rank<rr>.blob` → fast failure/segfault. **Re-run Step 1.**
   - the physical Tofu group changes (e.g. `12 19 15` → `7 19 0`) → any saved
     `tofu_topo.txt` is stale → `mpiexec` can't place ranks on nonexistent coords →
     instant `rc=1` (~2 s, "exceed limit on virtual coordinate"). **Never pass
     `SKIP_TOPO=1` across jobs** — let the launcher regenerate.

2. **There are two `tofu_topo.txt` files.** The run launcher reads the one in its CWD
   (`a64fx/llm/tofu_topo.txt`). Running the helper from `a64fx/utofu-tests/` writes a
   *different* file and does not update what the runner reads. Pre-verify from `llm/`
   or just trust the launcher's own regeneration (the default).

3. **Excluding the claude node.** claude's interactive node is the alloc node whose
   intra-group coord is `a=b=c=0`. Probe it: `utofu_query_my_coords()` prints
   `x y z 0 0 0`. own_mpi maps that to vcoord `(0,0,0)`, so `EXCLUDE=0,0,0` (the
   launcher default) drops it. **Verify** after topo regen: the placed
   `tofu_topo.txt` must NOT contain the `x y z 0 0 0` row.

   ```sh
   # one-shot probe of this node's coord (compile once):
   cat > /tmp/mycoord.c <<'EOF'
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <utofu.h>
   #ifndef TOFU_NCOORDS
   #define TOFU_NCOORDS 6
   #endif
   int main(void){uint8_t c[TOFU_NCOORDS]={0};
     if(utofu_query_my_coords(c))return 1;
     printf("%u %u %u %u %u %u\n",c[0],c[1],c[2],c[3],c[4],c[5]);return 0;}
   EOF
   fcc -Nclang -O3 -march=armv8.2-a+sve -o /tmp/mycoord /tmp/mycoord.c -ltofucom && /tmp/mycoord
   # -> e.g. "7 19 0 0 0 0"; then after the run, confirm:
   grep -c "7 19 0 0 0 0" a64fx/llm/tofu_topo.txt   # must print 0
   ```
   Running the heavy ~22 GB load on the claude node OOM-kills the claude session (shared
   cgroup). Staging on it is safe (file→file, bounded RSS) but pointless.

4. **Orphaned `org/mpiexec` (PPID=1)** from a killed run holds ranks → later
   "exceed limit on virtual coordinate". Check `pgrep -af 'org/mpiexec|ds4f_ep_runner'`
   and kill stale ones (use a pattern that does NOT self-match the killing shell).

5. **stdout is not forwarded** from `mpiexec`'d ranks — only file writes survive. Wait on
   the 11× per-rank files, NOT a stdout banner.

## Output discipline (keep agent context small)

Chain stage→run **detached** (`setsid nohup …`), funnel all output to log files, and
read only a compact sentinel — never stream the 11× per-rank dumps into the agent. A
single background waiter that polls the sentinel for an end marker (e.g. `RUN2_END`)
beats echo-ping polling. Pattern: write `STAGE done=N/11`, `RUN rc=…`, topo group,
crash grep, and the ~10-line `ds4f_ep_rank00.txt` to one `/tmp/*sentinel.txt`.

## Validated result (job 49092345, 2026-06-05)

```
STAGE done=11/11  wall=1272 s  (no OOM — bounded /local cache held)
RUN   rc=0  11/11 perf + 11/11 load  topo group 7 19 0 (claude excluded)
NaNs=0  argmax=122293  (deterministic; identical to the first validated run)
prefill  8 tok   95.8 ms/tok  10.44 tok/s  comm 13.3%  ar_calls=344
decode  16 tok   98.4 ms/tok  10.16 tok/s  comm 12.4%  72.9 GB/s-weights
arena 22.18 GB   RSS 21.81 GB / node   (fits ~25 GB usable HBM2)
per-phase decode: o_proj 33.4% + qkv 27.8% + shared 14.1% = ~75% replicated dense FP8;
                  experts 5.2%, attn 3.9%, head 2.2%, router 0.6%.
```

The dominator is replicated dense FP8 gather (same finding as the synthetic Stage 2/3
and the EP-runner). `DS4F_FP8_BF16=1` (Step 2c) promotes that dense to bf16-pv at load
and lifts real-weight decode to **16.73 tok/s** (+65 %); the remaining lever is batched
decode M>1 to amortize the 43 per-layer all-reduces.
