Warning:
Kernel address maps (/proc/{kallsyms,modules}) were restricted.

Check /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict before running 'perf record'.

As no suitable kallsyms nor vmlinux was found, kernel samples
can't be resolved.

Samples in kernel modules can't be resolved as well.

Error:
The perf_output/perf.data data has no samples!
